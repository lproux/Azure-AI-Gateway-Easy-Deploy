    "- **Round-Robin Distribution:** Balance traffic across Sweden Central and West Europe (50/50 weight)\n",
    "- **Automatic Retry:** APIM retries on HTTP 429 (rate limit) transparently\n",
    "- **Regional Headers:** Track which region served each request via `x-ms-region` header\n",

    "Azure API Management supports three load balancing strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><b>1. Round-Robin Distribution</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributes requests evenly across all backends with equal weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration:**\n",
    "- All backends have the same priority level\n",
    "- Equal weight distribution (or default weights)\n",
    "- Requests rotate sequentially through backends\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** When all regions have equal capacity and you want even distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><b>2. Priority-Based Routing</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower priority values receive traffic first, with automatic failover to higher priority backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Configuration:**\n",
    "- **East US:** Priority 1 (primary)\n",
    "- **West US:** Priority 2 (fallback)\n",
    "- **Sweden Central:** Priority 3 (fallback)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** When you have a preferred region for latency or cost reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><b>3. Weighted Load Balancing</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigns different traffic proportions within the same priority level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Configuration:**\n",
    "- **East US:** Priority 1, Weight 100\n",
    "- **West US:** Priority 2, Weight 50\n",
    "- **Sweden Central:** Priority 2, Weight 50\n",
    "\n",
    "When Priority 1 is unavailable, traffic splits 50/50 between Priority 2 backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** When backends have different capacities or you want controlled traffic distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Breaker Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "> **💡 Tip:** Each backend should have a circuit breaker rule to handle failures gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Settings:**\n",
    "- **Failure Count:** 1 (trip after single failure)\n",
    "- **Failure Interval:** 5 minutes\n",
    "- **Custom Range:** HTTP 429 (rate limit)\n",
    "- **Trip Duration:** 1 minute\n",
    "- **Retry-After Header:** Enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration ensures that when a backend hits its rate limit (HTTP 429), APIM automatically routes traffic to other backends for 1 minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitoring Regional Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Note:** The `x-ms-region` header in responses indicates which backend processed the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This header allows you to:\n",
    "- Verify load distribution patterns\n",
    "- Monitor failover behavior\n",
    "- Analyze regional performance\n",
    "- Debug routing issues\n",

    "- **Communication:** Request/response pattern\n",

    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Simple, reliable, works with standard HTTP clients\n",

      "It seems I am unable to retrieve specific documents at the moment. However, I can provide you with key steps typically involved in publishing a server, particularly in a Managed Cloud Platform (MCP) context. Here are the general steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Server Configuration**:\n",
      "   - Define the server specifications including CPU, memory, and storage.\n",
      "   - Ensure the operating system is properly installed and configured based on application requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Set Up Networking**:\n",
      "   - Configure the network settings, including virtual network (VNet) and subnet.\n",
      "   - Set up necessary firewall rules and security groups to control access to the server.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Install Required Software**:\n",
      "   - Install necessary software packages, dependencies, and configuration management tools.\n",
      "   - Ensure that the server is updated to the latest security patches.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Create and Configure the Environment**:\n",
      "   - Set up runtime environments, database connections, and API endpoints.\n",
      "   - Implement logging and monitoring tools as needed for observability.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Deploy the Application**:\n",
      "   - Upload application files to the server.\n",
      "   - Configure the application settings to ensure proper operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Testing**:\n",
      "   - Perform thorough testing, including functional, performance, and security tests.\n",
      "   - Identify and fix any issues that arise during testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Publish the Server**:\n",
      "   - Make the server accessible to users or external systems, typically by updating DNS settings or load balancers.\n",
      "   - Ensure that all connections are secured (SSL/TLS) if applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Monitor and Maintain**:\n",
      "   - Set up monitoring for performance, uptime, and error tracking.\n",
      "   - Schedule regular maintenance and update cycles for the server and applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery Planning**:\n",
      "   - Implement a backup strategy to protect against data loss.\n",
      "   - Develop a disaster recovery plan to restore services in the event of failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that the specifics can vary widely based on the MCP and the applications being deployed, so it's advisable to refer to your platform's specific documentation for detailed, context-relevant steps.\n",

    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **AutoGen Agent Orchestration**: Use AssistantAgent with tool calling capabilities\n",
    "- **MCP Tool Integration**: Connect to MCP servers via SSE (Server-Sent Events)\n",
    "- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Use AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient for model access\n",
    "- **Streaming Responses**: Display agent conversations via Console UI\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Learn:**\n",
    "- Configure AutoGen agents with Azure OpenAI models\n",
    "- Connect MCP servers as tool providers\n",
    "- Stream agent responses for interactive UX\n",
    "- Use multiple MCP servers in agent workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- AutoGen packages: `autogen-agentchat`, `autogen-ext`\n",
    "- MCP servers deployed and accessible\n",
