    "**Setup:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Login interactively\n",
    "az login\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select subscription (if you have multiple)\n",
    "az account set --subscription \"subscription-name-or-id\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Simplest for local development\n",
    "- Uses your personal Azure credentials\n",
    "- No additional setup required\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed locally\n",
    "- User account with sufficient permissions (Contributor role)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running Section 0, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required\n",
    "1. **Azure Subscription** with sufficient quota:\n",
    "   - API Management: 1 instance (Developer or Premium tier)\n",
    "   - AI Services: 3 accounts (S0 tier)\n",
    "   - Redis Cache: 1 instance (Basic or Standard)\n",
    "   - Cosmos DB: 1 account (Serverless or Provisioned)\n",
    "   - AI Search: 1 service (Basic or Standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure Permissions**: Contributor role on subscription or resource group\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Azure CLI**: Installed and configured (v2.50.0 or later)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Python Environment**:\n",
    "   - Python 3.8 or later\n",
    "   - pip package manager\n",
    "   - Virtual environment (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional but Recommended\n",
    "- **VS Code**: With Jupyter extension for notebook editing\n",
    "- **GitHub Codespaces**: Pre-configured environment with all tools\n",
    "- **Docker**: For running MCP servers locally\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook automatically detects your environment:\n",
    "- **GitHub Codespaces**: Auto-configures paths and settings\n",
    "- **Local (WSL/Linux)**: Uses local Azure CLI\n",
    "- **Local (Windows)**: Detects Windows paths\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Start Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**For first-time users:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose authentication method** (pick one):\n",
    "   - Option A: Service Principal \u2192 Run Cell 9, provide credentials when prompted\n",
    "   - Option B: Azure CLI \u2192 Run `az login` in terminal before Cell 1\n",
    "   - Option C: Managed Identity \u2192 No action needed if on Azure compute\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run cells in order**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Cell 3:  Environment Detection\n",
    "   Cell 5:  Bootstrap Configuration\n",
    "   Cell 7:  Install Dependencies (~5 min)\n",
    "   Cell 9:  Azure Authentication Setup\n",
    "   Cell 11: Load Helper Functions\n",
    "   Cell 14: Set Deployment Configuration\n",
    "   Cell 18: Deploy Infrastructure (~35 min)\n",
    "   Cell 21: Generate master-lab.env file\n",
    "   Cell 23: Reload Configuration\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify deployment**:\n",
    "   - Check Azure Portal for resources\n",
    "   - Ensure `master-lab.env` file exists\n",
    "   - Verify environment variables are loaded\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Proceed to labs**: Jump to [Lab 1: Access Control](#lab1-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Azure CLI not found\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Install Azure CLI from https://aka.ms/installazurecli\n",
    "- **Or**: Set `AZURE_CLI_PATH` environment variable to CLI location\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Please run 'az login'\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Run `az login` in terminal or set Service Principal credentials\n",
    "- **Check**: Run `az account show` to verify authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Insufficient quota for deployment\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Request quota increase in Azure Portal (Support \u2192 Quotas)\n",
    "- **Or**: Use different regions with available quota\n",
    "- **Note**: AI Services quota often needs increase for multiple deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Deployment timeout\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Azure deployments can take time; wait for completion\n",
    "- **Check**: View deployment status in Azure Portal \u2192 Resource Group \u2192 Deployments\n",
    "- **Retry**: Re-run the deployment cell (it's idempotent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Module not found\" errors\n",
    "- **Solution**: Run Cell 7 (Dependencies Install) completely\n",
    "- **Check**: Restart kernel after installing dependencies\n",
    "- **Verify**: Run `pip list | grep azure` to confirm packages installed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After Section 0 completes successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Verify deployment**: Check that all resources exist in Azure Portal\n",
    "2. **Review configuration**: Open `master-lab.env` to see all settings\n",
    "3. **Choose labs**: Pick from 12 comprehensive labs covering:\n",
    "   - Access Control (JWT and API keys)\n",
    "   - Load Balancing (multi-region)\n",
    "   - Semantic Caching (Redis + embeddings)\n",
    "   - Message Storing (Cosmos DB)\n",
    "   - Vector Search (AI Search + RAG)\n",
    "   - LLM Logging (Log Analytics)\n",
    "   - MCP Integration (Excel, Docs, GitHub, Weather)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Start learning**: Jump to any lab using the table of contents\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "- Azure CLI installed and accessible\n",
    "- Environment variable `AZ_CLI` or `AZURE_CLI_PATH` set\n",
    "- Optional: Service Principal credentials (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)\n",

    "- Automatically handles authentication (Service Principal or interactive)\n",
    "- Supports JSON output parsing for easy data extraction\n",
    "- Includes timeout controls and error handling\n",
    "- Auto-retries with login if authentication expires\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Deployment Helpers**\n",
    "Functions for infrastructure deployment:\n",
    "- `compile_bicep(bicep_path)` - Compiles Bicep templates to ARM JSON\n",
    "- `deploy_template(rg, name, template_file, params)` - Deploys ARM templates\n",
    "- `get_deployment_outputs(rg, name)` - Retrieves deployment outputs\n",
    "- `ensure_deployment(rg, name, template, params)` - Smart deployment with skip-if-exists logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Policy Application Helper**\n",
    "- `apply_policies(policies)` - Applies API Management policies via Azure REST API\n",
    "- Automatically discovers API IDs if not provided\n",
    "- Supports multiple policy applications in sequence\n",
    "- Uses REST API for broader CLI version compatibility\n",

    "## 0.9 Access Controlling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Implement OAuth 2.0 based access control to restrict API access by user or client. This lab demonstrates how to use Azure AD (Entra ID) as an identity provider for fine-grained authorization on Azure OpenAI models through APIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization:** Configure identity provider-based authentication\n",
    "- **Token Acquisition:** Request tokens from Azure AD for authenticated API calls\n",
    "- **Bearer Tokens:** Include tokens in API requests for authorization\n",
    "- **Access Scopes:** Define granular permissions for different API endpoints\n",
    "- **Token Expiration:** Handle token refresh and expiration scenarios\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting:** Debug 401/403 errors and policy propagation delays\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Client application requests OAuth token from Azure AD\n",
    "2. Azure AD validates credentials and returns access token\n",
    "3. Client includes token in Authorization header (Bearer token)\n",
    "4. APIM policy validates token with Azure AD\n",
    "5. Policy checks token scope against API requirements\n",
    "6. Authorized requests proceed to backend Azure OpenAI\n",
    "7. Unauthorized requests return 403 Forbidden\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Azure AD application registration (created during deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Successful authentication with valid OAuth token\n",
    "- Requests with invalid/missing tokens receive 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "- Token-based access control enforced at APIM level\n",
    "- Can observe policy evaluation in APIM tracing\n",
    "- Different users can have different access levels\n",
    "- Token expiration properly handled with refresh\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Issues & Solutions\n",
    "| Issue | Solution |\n",
    "|-------|----------|\n",
    "| 401 Unauthorized | Wait 30-60 seconds for policy to propagate |\n",
    "| 500 Internal Server Error | Check backend health with Azure CLI |\n",
    "| Token not found | Run `az login` to authenticate |\n",
    "| Missing API Key | Verify APIM_API_KEY in environment variables |"

    "### Test 2: JWT Token Authentication (Azure AD)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates OAuth 2.0 authentication using Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) bearer tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Azure CLI authenticated (`az login` completed)\n",
    "- APIM service deployed with JWT validation policy active\n",
    "- Environment variables loaded from `master-lab.env`:\n",
    "  - `APIM_GATEWAY_URL`\n",
    "  - `RESOURCE_GROUP`\n",
    "  - `APIM_SERVICE`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**This test demonstrates enterprise-grade authentication using Azure AD:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acquires Azure AD Token:**\n",
    "   - Uses Azure CLI to obtain a bearer token\n",
    "   - Token is scoped to Azure Cognitive Services\n",
    "   - Token represents the authenticated user's identity\n",
    "   - Token has limited lifetime (typically 1 hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Makes Authenticated API Request:**\n",
    "   - Sends POST request to APIM gateway\n",
    "   - Includes JWT token in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`\n",
    "   - Requests a simple chat completion from GPT-4\n",
    "   - Does NOT include API subscription key\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **APIM Policy Validation:**\n",
    "   - APIM validates the JWT token signature\n",
    "   - Checks token issuer, audience, and claims\n",
    "   - Ensures token hasn't expired\n",
    "   - Allows request if token is valid, returns 401 if invalid\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Handling:**\n",
    "   - Displays the AI-generated response if successful\n",
    "   - Shows error details if authentication fails\n",
    "   - Measures and displays response time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Benefits:**\n",
    "- No static API keys transmitted\n",
    "- Tokens are short-lived and rotatable\n",
    "- User identity can be tracked for audit logs\n",
    "- Fine-grained access control via Azure AD roles\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "When JWT policy is active:\n",
    "\u2705 **SUCCESS** - Request succeeds with 200 status code\n",
    "- Bearer token successfully validated by APIM\n",
    "- AI model response returned\n",
    "- Response time displayed\n",
    "\n",
    "When JWT policy is NOT active or token is invalid:\n",
    "\u274c **FAIL** - Request fails with 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "- Error message indicating authentication failure\n",
    "- Details about token validation error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: JWT validation requires specific APIM policy configuration.\n",

    "### Test 4: Dual Authentication (JWT + API Key)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates using both JWT token and API subscription key simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Azure CLI authenticated\n",
    "- APIM subscription key available\n",
    "- APIM configured to accept both authentication methods\n",
    "- Environment variables from `master-lab.env`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Tests the most secure authentication pattern: defense in depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acquires Both Credentials:**\n",
    "   - JWT bearer token from Azure AD\n",
    "   - API subscription key from environment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sends Dual-Authenticated Request:**\n",
    "   - Authorization header: `Bearer <jwt_token>`\n",
    "   - Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header: `<api_key>`\n",
    "   - Both credentials included in same request\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **APIM Policy Behavior:**\n",
    "   - Can validate EITHER credential (OR logic)\n",
    "   - Can require BOTH credentials (AND logic)\n",
    "   - Configuration depends on policy design\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Migration scenarios (supporting both old and new auth)\n",
    "   - Defense in depth (multiple auth layers)\n",
    "   - Different auth for different operations\n",
    "   - Compliance requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:**\n",
    "Dual authentication provides maximum flexibility during transitions but should eventually converge to JWT-only for enterprise scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "\u2705 **SUCCESS** - Request succeeds with both credentials\n",
    "- APIM validates both authentication methods\n",
    "- Response shows successful authorization\n",
    "- Useful for migration and compliance scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Note:**\n",
    "In production, choose one primary authentication method for consistency.\n",

    "### 1.1.2 Apply Caching Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Applies the semantic caching policy to the APIM API\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Redis cache deployed and accessible\n",
    "- Embeddings backend configured (previous cell)\n",
    "- APIM service and API deployed\n",
    "- Policy XML file available\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Applies the semantic caching policy to enable intelligent caching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loads Policy XML:**\n",
    "   - Reads semantic caching policy from file\n",
    "   - Policy includes Redis connection strings\n",
    "   - Policy includes embeddings endpoint configuration\n",
    "   - Policy defines similarity threshold (e.g., 0.90 = 90% similar)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Policy Components:**\n",
    "   - **Inbound**: Generates embeddings for incoming query\n",
    "   - **Inbound**: Searches Redis for similar cached queries\n",
    "   - **Inbound**: Returns cached response if similarity > threshold\n",
    "   - **Outbound**: Stores new responses with embeddings in Redis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Redis host and password from environment\n",
    "   - Embeddings endpoint and key from environment\n",
    "   - Similarity threshold (adjustable)\n",
    "   - Cache TTL (time-to-live)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applies Policy:**\n",
    "   - Uses APIM REST API to update API policy\n",
    "   - Validates XML syntax\n",
    "   - Activates policy immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "- First request: Generate embeddings \u2192 Call AI model \u2192 Cache with embeddings\n",
    "- Similar request: Generate embeddings \u2192 Find similar in cache \u2192 Return cached response (fast!)\n",
    "- Dissimilar request: No cache hit \u2192 Call AI model \u2192 Cache new response\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "- Policy XML loaded successfully\n",
    "- Policy applied to APIM API\n",
    "- Semantic caching now active\n",
    "- Confirmation message showing policy activation\n",
    "- Ready to test semantic caching performance\n",

    "2. **Line Chart - Performance Over Time:**\n",
    "   - Shows how response time improves with caching\n",
    "   - Demonstrates learning effect as cache fills\n",
    "   - Useful for capacity planning\n",

    "3. **Speedup Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Calculates and displays speedup factors\n",
    "   - Shows percentage improvements\n",
    "   - Highlights cost savings (fewer AI model calls)\n",

    "   - Average cache miss time\n",
    "   - Cache hit rate percentage\n",
    "   - Total time saved\n",

    "**Business Impact:**\n",
    "- Lower latency = better user experience\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Displays Redis cache statistics and metrics for monitoring caching effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Redis cache accessible\n",
    "- Redis connection string from environment\n",
    "- Redis Python client library (redis-py)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Retrieves and displays Redis cache statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cache Metrics:**\n",
    "   - Total keys stored\n",
    "   - Memory usage\n",
    "   - Cache hit rate\n",
    "   - Eviction statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantic Cache Specific:**\n",
    "   - Number of cached query embeddings\n",
    "   - Storage per embedding\n",
    "   - TTL (time-to-live) settings\n",
    "   - Expiration policy\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Insights:**\n",
    "   - Shows how cache is filling up\n",
    "   - Identifies optimal similarity threshold\n",
    "   - Helps tune cache size\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitoring:**\n",
    "   - Track cache effectiveness over time\n",
    "   - Identify when to scale Redis\n",
    "   - Optimize cache eviction policies\n",
    "\n",

    "## 1.2 Message Storing with Cosmos DB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Build a persistent audit trail of all LLM interactions by storing prompts, completions, and token metrics in Cosmos DB. This lab demonstrates a data pipeline from APIM logging through Event Hub to long-term storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Built-in LLM Logging:** Capture prompts and completions automatically\n",
    "- **Event Hub Integration:** Stream logging data to Event Hub\n",
    "- **Stream Analytics:** Process and transform log data in flight\n",
    "- **Cosmos DB Storage:** Persist structured interaction data\n",
    "- **Document Querying:** Query stored interactions for audit and analysis\n",
    "- **Data Pipeline:** Understand full flow from API to persistent storage\n",
    "- **Scalable Architecture:** Handle high-volume LLM interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. User request processed by APIM\n",
    "2. Built-in logging captures prompt, completion, and metadata\n",
    "3. Logs sent to Azure Monitor\n",
    "4. Diagnostic settings export logs to Event Hub\n",
    "5. Stream Analytics consumes Event Hub messages\n",
    "6. Analytics transforms and enriches message data\n",
    "7. Data written to Cosmos DB for long-term storage\n",
    "8. Applications query Cosmos DB for interaction history\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow Diagram\n",
    "```\n",
    "[APIM] \u2192 [Azure Monitor] \u2192 [Event Hub] \u2192 [Stream Analytics] \u2192 [Cosmos DB]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Cosmos DB account (created during deployment)\n",
    "- Event Hub namespace (created during deployment)\n",
    "- Stream Analytics job (created during deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Prompts and completions logged to Azure Monitor\n",
    "- Logs appear in Event Hub within seconds\n",
    "- Stream Analytics job processes and transforms data\n",
    "- Documents appear in Cosmos DB within 1-2 minutes\n",
    "- Can query stored interactions by user, timestamp, model\n",
    "- Audit trail shows complete interaction history\n",
    "- Token metrics aggregated and stored\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Cosmos DB Query\n",
    "```kusto\n",
    "SELECT c.user_id, c.prompt, c.completion, c.token_count, c.timestamp\n",
    "FROM messages c\n",
    "WHERE c.timestamp > GetCurrentTimestamp() - 3600\n",
    "ORDER BY c.timestamp DESC\n",

    "   - Includes conversation context\n",
    "   - Partitioned by user ID for scalability\n",
    "   - Indexed for fast querying\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Message Schema:**\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     \"id\": \"unique-message-id\",\n",
    "     \"conversation_id\": \"session-uuid\",\n",
    "     \"user_id\": \"user-identifier\",\n",

    "     \"metadata\": {}\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Compliance and auditing\n",
    "   - Conversation history\n",
    "   - User behavior analysis\n",
    "   - Quality assurance\n",
    "   - Training data collection\n",
    "   - Cost tracking per user\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compliance Benefits:**\n",
    "   - Complete audit trail\n",
    "   - Searchable conversation history\n",
    "   - Retention policy enforcement\n",
    "   - PII handling and redaction support\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates querying and analyzing stored conversation messages from Cosmos DB\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Messages stored in Cosmos DB (from previous cell)\n",
    "- Cosmos DB Python SDK\n",
    "- pandas library for data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Performs various queries on stored conversation data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Examples:**\n",
    "   - Get all messages for a specific user\n",
    "   - Get all messages in a conversation\n",
    "   - Find conversations by date range\n",
    "   - Search messages by content keywords\n",
    "   - Aggregate token usage by user\n",
    "   - Calculate conversation statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SQL Query Features:**\n",
    "   - Uses Cosmos DB SQL API\n",
    "   - Supports complex filtering\n",
    "   - Enables cross-partition queries\n",
    "   - Provides pagination for large results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analytics Queries:**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- Total tokens per user\n",
    "   SELECT c.user_id, SUM(c.tokens_used) as total_tokens\n",
    "   FROM conversations c\n",
    "   GROUP BY c.user_id\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Recent conversations\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM conversations c\n",
    "   WHERE c.timestamp > '2025-01-01'\n",
    "   ORDER BY c.timestamp DESC\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Visualization:**\n",
    "   - Displays results as formatted tables\n",
    "   - Shows conversation flow\n",
    "   - Highlights key metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Business Value:**\n",
    "   - User engagement metrics\n",

    "#### Objective\n",
    "Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance Azure OpenAI responses with current information from a knowledge base. This lab demonstrates how to search vector embeddings in Azure AI Search and augment LLM responses with retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Vector Embeddings:** Convert documents and queries to embeddings\n",
    "- **Azure AI Search:** Index and search documents using vector similarity\n",
    "- **RAG Pattern:** Combine retrieval with generative AI for accurate responses\n",
    "- **Prompt Augmentation:** Add retrieved context to LLM prompts\n",
    "- **End-to-End Flow:** From document ingestion through response generation\n",
    "- **APIM Gateway:** Route embedding and search requests through APIM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Knowledge base documents uploaded and indexed in Azure AI Search\n",
    "2. Each document chunked and embedded using text-embedding-3-small\n",
    "3. Vector embeddings stored in AI Search index\n",
    "4. User asks question to APIM gateway\n",
    "5. Question embedded using same embedding model\n",
    "6. AI Search performs vector similarity search\n",
    "7. Top matching documents retrieved and ranked\n",
    "8. Retrieved documents added to LLM prompt as context\n",
    "9. Azure OpenAI generates response augmented with retrieved information\n",
    "10. Response returned to user with source attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Documents] \u2192 [Chunking] \u2192 [Embedding] \u2192 [AI Search Index]\n",
    "                                              \u2193\n",
    "[User Query] \u2192 [Embedding] \u2192 [Vector Search] \u2192 [Top Results]\n",
    "                                                    \u2193\n",
    "[Context + Query] \u2192 [Azure OpenAI] \u2192 [Augmented Response]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",

    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor permissions\n",
    "- Azure AI Search instance (created during deployment)\n",
    "- Sample documents for knowledge base\n",
    "- text-embedding-3-small model access\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Documents successfully indexed with embeddings\n",
    "- Vector search returns relevant documents\n",
    "- Retrieved context properly formatted for LLM\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI generates contextually accurate responses\n",
    "- Source documents attributed in responses\n",
    "- Search relevance improves with better document chunking\n",
    "- Response quality enhanced by augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Metrics\n",
    "- Embedding generation latency: <1 second per query\n",
    "- Vector search latency: <500ms\n",
    "- Response generation: 2-5 seconds depending on context\n",
    "- Accuracy: Measured by user satisfaction with RAG responses"

    "### 1.3.1 Index Sample Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Indexes sample documents in Azure AI Search with embeddings for vector search and RAG patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Azure AI Search deployed (from infrastructure)\n",
    "- Environment variables: `AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`, `AI_SEARCH_KEY`\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI embeddings endpoint configured\n",
    "- Search index created (from Step 1.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Indexes sample documents with vector embeddings for semantic search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepares Sample Documents:**\n",
    "   - Creates sample documents about various topics\n",
    "   - Each document has: id, title, content, metadata\n",
    "   - Documents cover diverse domains for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generates Embeddings:**\n",
    "   - Sends each document's content to Azure OpenAI embeddings API\n",
    "   - Uses text-embedding-ada-002 model\n",
    "   - Generates 1536-dimension vectors\n",
    "   - Embeddings capture semantic meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Uploads to AI Search:**\n",
    "   - Creates/updates search index with vector field\n",
    "   - Configures vector search algorithm (HNSW)\n",
    "   - Uploads documents with embeddings\n",
    "   - Enables hybrid search (keyword + vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Index Configuration:**\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     \"fields\": [\n",
    "       {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"Edm.String\", \"key\": true},\n",
    "       {\"name\": \"title\", \"type\": \"Edm.String\", \"searchable\": true},\n",
    "       {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"Edm.String\", \"searchable\": true},\n",
    "       {\"name\": \"contentVector\", \"type\": \"Collection(Edm.Single)\",\n",
    "        \"dimensions\": 1536, \"vectorSearchProfile\": \"vector-profile\"}\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Vector Search Benefits:**\n",
    "   - Semantic similarity search (not just keyword matching)\n",
    "   - Finds conceptually related documents\n",
    "   - Better for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n",
    "   - Handles synonyms and paraphrasing naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Documents Indexed:**\n",
    "- Technical documentation\n",
    "- Product descriptions\n",
    "- FAQ entries\n",
    "- Policy documents\n",
    "- Knowledge base articles\n",
    "\n",

    "### 1.3.2 Test RAG Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by combining vector search with AI completion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Documents indexed in AI Search (from previous cell)\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI chat completion endpoint\n",
    "- Azure AI Search configured with vector search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Implements the full RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Query Processing:**\n",
    "   - Takes a natural language question\n",
    "   - Example: \"What are the best practices for API security?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step 1 - Retrieve (Vector Search):**\n",
    "   - Converts query to embedding vector\n",
    "   - Searches indexed documents using vector similarity\n",
    "   - Finds top-K most relevant documents (e.g., K=3)\n",
    "   - Uses cosine similarity for ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step 2 - Augment (Context Building):**\n",
    "   - Extracts relevant content from retrieved documents\n",
    "   - Builds context string with source citations\n",
    "   - Formats context for AI model consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Step 3 - Generate (AI Completion):**\n",
    "   - Sends query + context to AI model\n",
    "   - AI generates answer grounded in retrieved documents\n",
    "   - Answer includes source references\n",
    "   - Reduces hallucinations by providing factual context\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Complete RAG Flow:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   User Query\n",
    "      \u2193\n",
    "   Generate Query Embedding\n",
    "      \u2193\n",

    "   AI Generates Grounded Response\n",
    "      \u2193\n",
    "   Return Answer with Sources\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **RAG Benefits:**\n",
    "   - Answers grounded in your own data\n",
    "   - Reduces AI hallucinations\n",
    "   - Citations for fact-checking\n",
    "   - Works with private/proprietary data\n",

    "#### Objective\n",
    "Understand multi-region Azure OpenAI deployment patterns by implementing backend pool load balancing. This lab demonstrates a typical prioritized PTU (Provisioned Throughput Units) with fallback consumption scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Backend Pool Configuration:** Define priority-based routing rules in APIM\n",
    "- **Load Distribution:** Understand how requests route across multiple endpoints\n",
    "- **Failover Behavior:** See graceful degradation when backends reach capacity\n",
    "- **Priority-Based Routing:** Configure primary (Priority 1) and fallback (Priority 2) endpoints\n",
    "- **Monitoring:** Track request distribution and backend health\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Client requests arrive at APIM gateway\n",
    "2. APIM evaluates backend pool configuration\n",
    "3. Priority 1 backend (highest priority PTU) receives requests first\n",
    "4. When Priority 1 is exhausted or unavailable, requests failover to Priority 2 backends\n",
    "5. Multiple Priority 2 backends are load-balanced equally\n",
    "6. Metrics show distribution of requests across backends\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Observe load distribution patterns in metrics\n",
    "- See Priority 1 backend exhaustion after threshold is reached\n",
    "- Confirm automatic failover to Priority 2 backends\n",
    "- Verify equal load distribution among Priority 2 endpoints\n",
    "- Response times remain consistent despite failover"

    "### 1.5.1 Create Backend Pool\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Creates a backend pool in APIM for distributing load across multiple Azure OpenAI regional deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- APIM service deployed\n",
    "- Three Azure OpenAI accounts in different regions (East US, West US, Sweden Central)\n",
    "- APIM Preview API version (2023-05-01-preview or later)\n",
    "- Environment variables: `APIM_SERVICE`, `RESOURCE_GROUP`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Creates a multi-region backend pool for high availability and load distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backend Pool Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Defines 3 backends (one per region)\n",
    "   - Each backend points to regional Azure OpenAI endpoint\n",
    "   - Configures weight distribution (can be equal or weighted)\n",
    "   - Sets priority for failover scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load Balancing Strategy:**\n",
    "   - **Round Robin**: Distributes requests evenly (default)\n",
    "   - **Weighted**: More traffic to higher capacity regions\n",
    "   - **Priority**: Failover to backup regions if primary fails\n",
    "   - **Performance**: Route to fastest responding region\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backend Configuration:**\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     \"backends\": [\n",
    "       {\n",
    "         \"id\": \"openai-eastus\",\n",
    "         \"url\": \"https://account-eastus.openai.azure.com\",\n",
    "         \"weight\": 33,\n",
    "         \"priority\": 1\n",
    "       },\n",
    "       {\n",
    "         \"id\": \"openai-westus\",\n",
    "         \"url\": \"https://account-westus.openai.azure.com\",\n",
    "         \"weight\": 33,\n",
    "         \"priority\": 1\n",
    "       },\n",
    "       {\n",
    "         \"id\": \"openai-swedencentral\",\n",
    "         \"url\": \"https://account-swedencentral.openai.azure.com\",\n",
    "         \"weight\": 34,\n",
    "         \"priority\": 1\n",
    "       }\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Health Checks:**\n",
    "   - APIM can probe backend health\n",
    "   - Automatically removes unhealthy backends\n",
    "   - Restores backends when health returns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Benefits:**\n",
    "   - **High Availability**: If one region fails, traffic routes to others\n",
    "   - **Performance**: Requests distributed across regions reduce queuing\n",
    "   - **Scalability**: Add more regions without client changes\n",
    "   - **Compliance**: Keep data in specific geographic regions\n",
    "   - **Cost Optimization**: Leverage regional pricing differences\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **APIM Policy Integration:**\n",
    "   - Policy uses backend pool ID instead of direct URLs\n",
    "   - APIM handles load balancing logic\n",
    "   - No client code changes required\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "Backend pool creation results:\n",
    "\u2705 Backend pool created successfully\n",
    "- Pool ID: openai-backend-pool\n",
    "- Backends: 3 regions\n",
    "- Load balancing: Round robin\n",
    "- Configuration:\n",
    "  * East US: 33% weight, priority 1\n",
    "  * West US: 33% weight, priority 1\n",
    "  * Sweden Central: 34% weight, priority 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend pool is now ready to be referenced in APIM policies.\n",

    "#### Objective\n",
    "Integrate Azure AI Foundry SDK with your APIM gateway to route all LLM requests through the API gateway while using native AI Foundry development patterns. This lab demonstrates how to configure the SDK to use APIM as the underlying Azure OpenAI endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **AI Foundry SDK:** Use Python SDK for AI Foundry projects\n",
    "- **Connection Configuration:** Configure Azure OpenAI connections with APIM endpoint\n",
    "- **Gateway Routing:** Route SDK requests through APIM automatically\n",
    "- **Model Catalog:** Access AI Foundry model catalog through APIM\n",
    "- **Policy Application:** All APIM policies apply to SDK requests\n",
    "- **Authentication:** Handle credentials seamlessly with APIM integration\n",
    "- **Development Patterns:** Use native SDK patterns with gateway benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Developer creates Azure AI Foundry project with AI Foundry SDK\n",
    "2. AI Foundry project has OpenAI connection configured\n",
    "3. OpenAI connection specifies APIM endpoint as the provider\n",
    "4. Developer uses standard AI Foundry SDK code\n",
    "5. SDK requests go to APIM instead of direct Azure OpenAI\n",
    "6. APIM applies all configured policies:\n",
    "   - Load balancing\n",
    "   - Rate limiting\n",
    "   - Content safety\n",
    "   - Token metrics\n",
    "   - Semantic caching\n",
    "   - Logging\n",
    "7. Requests forwarded to backend Azure OpenAI\n",
    "8. Responses returned through APIM to application\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor permissions\n",
    "- AI Foundry project created\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI connection configured with APIM endpoint\n",
    "- APIM subscription key configured\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- AI Foundry SDK initializes successfully\n",
    "- Requests are routed through APIM (visible in APIM logs)\n",
    "- Chat completions work through SDK\n",
    "- All APIM policies apply to SDK requests\n",
    "- Can track SDK usage in APIM analytics\n",
    "- No code changes needed to use APIM gateway\n",
    "- Token metrics appear in Application Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection Configuration Format\n",
    "```\n",
    "Provider: Azure OpenAI\n",
    "Endpoint: https://{APIM_GATEWAY}.azure-api.net\n",
    "Key: {APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}\n",
    "API Version: 2024-08-01-preview\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Benefits\n",
    "1. **Centralized Governance:** All AI Foundry SDK requests through APIM policies\n",
    "2. **Unified Monitoring:** Track all interactions in one place\n",
    "3. **Multi-Region Support:** APIM load balancing benefits\n",
    "4. **Cost Control:** Token metrics and rate limiting\n",
    "5. **Security:** All APIM security policies applied"

      "It seems that I couldn't retrieve specific documents for MCP server publishing. However, I can provide you with a general outline of the key steps involved in the process of publishing a server using the MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform) model. Here are the key steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Steps for MCP Server Publishing\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preparation**:\n",
      "   - Ensure that all necessary resources (code, assets) are ready for deployment.\n",
      "   - Set up an MCP project in your development environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Configuration**:\n",
      "   - Create a configuration file that specifies server settings, including environment variables, dependencies, and runtime configurations.\n",
      "   - Define the necessary services and resources (like databases, storage, etc.) in your configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Testing**:\n",
      "   - Thoroughly test your application locally to ensure that it behaves as expected.\n",
      "   - Use unit tests and integration tests to identify any potential issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Deployment**:\n",
      "   - Use deployment tools or scripts to push your application to the MCP environment.\n",
      "   - Make sure to follow the deployment steps specific to MCP, including commands for provisioning and deploying services.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Monitoring and Logging**:\n",
      "   - Implement monitoring tools to observe the performance and health of the application post-deployment.\n",
      "   - Set up logging mechanisms to capture errors and usage metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Scaling**:\n",
      "   - Configure autoscaling settings if needed, to handle varying loads and ensure the application performs well under different circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Updates and Maintenance**:\n",
      "   - Plan for regular updates and maintenance of the server and applications.\n",
      "   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities and apply patches as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Documentation**:\n",
      "   - Document the deployment process, configurations, and any unique aspects of your MCP server publishing for future reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "These steps may vary based on the specific requirements of your project and the tools you are using for MCP server publishing. If you have access to the official MCP documentation or resources, it would be beneficial to consult them for more detailed guidance.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates accessing OpenWeather API through APIM as an MCP-style data source\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- APIM deployed with Weather API configured\n",
    "- OpenWeather API key configured\n",
    "- Environment variables: `APIM_WEATHER_URL`, `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`\n",

    "**Accesses weather data through APIM gateway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weather API Features:**\n",
    "   - Current weather for any city\n",
    "   - Multi-day forecasts\n",
    "   - Weather alerts\n",
    "   - Historical weather data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **APIM Benefits:**\n",
    "   - Hides actual API key from clients\n",
    "   - Applies rate limiting\n",
    "   - Caches weather responses\n",
    "   - Transforms response format\n",
    "   - Logs all weather queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Queries:**\n",
    "   - Current weather in Seattle\n",
    "   - 5-day forecast for Paris\n",
    "   - Weather alerts for region\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integration with AI:**\n",
    "   - AI can call weather API via function calling\n",
    "   - Natural language: \"What's the weather in Tokyo?\"\n",
    "   - AI extracts city name and calls API\n",
    "   - Returns formatted weather info\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates using APIM as a unified gateway for both AI models and traditional APIs.\n",

    "#### Objective\n",
    "Integrate GitHub repository access through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to enable Azure OpenAI to read and analyze repository content. This lab demonstrates how to query GitHub repositories, list files, and retrieve content programmatically through APIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **MCP Server Integration:** Connect to GitHub API via MCP protocol\n",
    "- **Repository Navigation:** Browse files and directory structures\n",
    "- **Content Retrieval:** Fetch file contents for analysis\n",
    "- **HTTP-Based MCP:** Use REST API to communicate with MCP servers\n",
    "- **APIM Routing:** Route MCP requests through APIM gateway\n",
    "- **Authentication:** Manage GitHub API credentials securely\n",
    "- **Data Processing:** Feed repository data to Azure OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Azure OpenAI needs to access GitHub repository data\n",
    "2. Function call requests GitHub repository MCP server via APIM\n",
    "3. MCP server receives request through `/mcp/` HTTP endpoint\n",
    "4. Server authenticates with GitHub API using configured credentials\n",
    "5. Server executes tool (list files, read content, etc.)\n",
    "6. Response returned to APIM\n",
    "7. APIM proxies response back to Azure OpenAI\n",
    "8. Azure OpenAI processes repository data and generates analysis\n",
    "9. Final response returned to user\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Azure OpenAI] \u2192 [APIM Gateway] \u2192 [GitHub MCP Server] \u2192 [GitHub API]\n",

    "- GitHub Account with repository access\n",
    "- GitHub personal access token (for API authentication)\n",
    "- MCP servers initialized (Cell 11)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Successfully list files in GitHub repository\n",
    "- Retrieve file contents from repository\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI can access repository structure\n",
    "- Function calls to GitHub MCP work through APIM\n",
    "- Responses properly formatted for LLM consumption\n",
    "- Can analyze repository structure and content\n",
    "- Performance metrics show latency through APIM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MCP Server Configuration\n",
    "```\n",
    "Protocol: HTTP POST\n",
    "Endpoint: https://{mcp-server}/mcp/\n",
    "Authentication: GitHub Personal Access Token\n",
    "Supported Tools:\n",
    "  - list_repository_files\n",
    "  - read_file_content\n",
    "  - get_repository_info\n",
    "  - search_files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2.7 Multi-MCP AI Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates combining multiple data sources (Excel, Docs, GitHub, Weather) with AI for cross-domain analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- All MCP servers and APIM APIs configured\n",
    "- Excel MCP, Docs MCP, GitHub API, Weather API accessible\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI with function calling support (GPT-4 or GPT-4o)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Implements sophisticated multi-source AI analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Sources Orchestration:**\n",
    "   - **Excel MCP**: Business data, analytics, charts\n",
    "   - **Docs MCP**: Technical documentation, policies\n",
    "   - **GitHub API**: Code repositories, commits\n",
    "   - **Weather API**: Real-time weather data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **AI Function Calling:**\n",
    "   - Defines tool functions for each data source\n",
    "   - AI automatically chooses which tools to use\n",
    "   - AI combines data from multiple sources\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Cross-Domain Queries:**\n",
    "   - \"Analyze sales data (Excel), check if related docs (Docs) exist, and see if weather (Weather) affects sales\"\n",
    "   - \"Find repositories (GitHub) related to topics in our documents (Docs)\"\n",
    "   - \"Correlate employee location weather (Weather) with productivity metrics (Excel)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implementation Flow:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   User Query\n",
    "      \u2193\n",
    "   AI analyzes query \u2192 determines needed data sources\n",
    "      \u2193\n",
    "   AI calls multiple tools in sequence:\n",
    "      1. Excel tool \u2192 get sales data\n",
    "      2. Weather tool \u2192 get weather for sales regions\n",
    "      3. Docs tool \u2192 find related documentation\n",
    "      \u2193\n",
    "   AI synthesizes insights from all sources\n",
    "      \u2193\n",
    "   Returns comprehensive answer with sources\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Advanced Features:**\n",
    "   - **Parallel calls**: AI can call multiple tools simultaneously\n",
    "   - **Sequential reasoning**: AI uses results from one tool to inform next calls\n",
    "   - **Error handling**: Gracefully handles unavailable data sources\n",
    "   - **Citation**: AI cites which data source provided each fact\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Business Value:**\n",
    "   - **Unified Intelligence**: Single AI interface to all data\n",
    "   - **Contextual Insights**: Combines diverse data for richer analysis\n",
    "   - **Automated Workflows**: AI orchestrates complex multi-step queries\n",
    "   - **Reduced Development**: No manual integration code per data source\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the most advanced lab, demonstrating the full power of MCP + APIM + AI orchestration.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3.5 Built-in LLM Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Enable comprehensive observability of all LLM interactions through APIM's built-in logging capabilities. Automatically capture prompts, completions, and token consumption to Azure Monitor for compliance, debugging, and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Built-in Logging:** Configure APIM to automatically log LLM interactions\n",
    "- **Azure Monitor Integration:** Send logs to Azure Monitor for centralized analysis\n",
    "- **KQL Queries:** Write queries to analyze prompt and completion patterns\n",
    "- **Token Tracking:** Monitor token consumption across all requests\n",
    "- **Diagnostic Settings:** Route logs to Log Analytics, Event Hub, and Storage\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting:** Debug issues using detailed interaction logs\n",
    "- **Compliance:** Maintain audit trails for regulatory requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Request arrives at APIM with user prompt\n",
    "2. Built-in logging policy captures full request/response\n",
    "3. Extracts: prompt text, completion text, token counts\n",
    "4. Logs sent to Azure Monitor Diagnostic Logs\n",
    "5. Logs routed to:\n",
    "   - Log Analytics workspace for querying\n",
    "   - Event Hub for real-time streaming\n",
    "   - Storage account for long-term archival\n",
    "6. Can create alerts based on log patterns\n",
    "7. Dashboards visualize logging metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Log Analytics workspace (created during deployment)\n",
    "- APIM diagnostic settings configured\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- All API requests logged to Azure Monitor\n",
    "- Prompts and completions captured in full detail\n",
    "- Token counts tracked for cost analysis\n",
    "- Can query logs using KQL within 2-5 minutes\n",
    "- Logs appear in configured destinations (Log Analytics, Event Hub, etc.)\n",
    "- Can search logs by user, timestamp, model, or response status\n",
    "- Dashboards show real-time logging metrics\n",

    "**Generates diverse test traffic to populate logging data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creates Varied Requests:**\n",
    "   - Different models: gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4\n",
    "   - Different prompt lengths\n",
    "   - Different response lengths\n",
    "   - Different users/subscriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Scenarios:**\n",
    "   - Short prompts (10-50 tokens)\n",
    "   - Medium prompts (50-200 tokens)\n",
    "   - Long prompts (200-500 tokens)\n",
    "   - Streaming vs non-streaming\n",
    "   - Different temperature settings\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metadata Captured:**\n",
    "   - Request timestamp\n",

    "   - Tokens consumed (prompt + completion)\n",
    "   - Response time\n",
    "   - Subscription ID\n",

    "4. **Logging Integration:**\n",
    "   - APIM policy intercepts each request\n",
    "   - Extracts token usage from response\n",
    "   - Writes log entry to Log Analytics\n",
    "   - Includes custom dimensions\n",
