    "\n",
    "## Authentication Options\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook supports three authentication methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Service Principal (Recommended for Automation)\n",
    "Best for: CI/CD, automation, production deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create service principal\n",
    "az ad sp create-for-rbac --name \"ai-gateway-sp\" --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set environment variables (done automatically by Cell 9)\n",
    "export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=\"<client-id>\"\n",
    "export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=\"<client-secret>\"\n",
    "export AZURE_TENANT_ID=\"<tenant-id>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Non-interactive (no browser login required)\n",
    "- Works in automated environments\n",
    "- Reproducible deployments\n",
    "- Can be used in CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Service principal created with Contributor role\n",

    "- No secrets to manage\n",
    "- Automatic credential rotation\n",
    "- Highest security posture\n",
    "- Works seamlessly on Azure compute\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Notebook running on Azure compute resource\n",
    "- Managed identity assigned to the resource\n",
    "- Identity has necessary Azure roles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: Azure CLI Login (Recommended for Interactive Development)\n",
    "Best for: Local development, learning, testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Login interactively\n",
    "az login\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select subscription (if you have multiple)\n",
    "az account set --subscription \"subscription-name-or-id\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Simplest for local development\n",
    "- Uses your personal Azure credentials\n",
    "- No additional setup required\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed locally\n",
    "- User account with sufficient permissions (Contributor role)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running Section 0, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required\n",
    "1. **Azure Subscription** with sufficient quota:\n",
    "   - API Management: 1 instance (Developer or Premium tier)\n",
    "   - AI Services: 3 accounts (S0 tier)\n",
    "   - Redis Cache: 1 instance (Basic or Standard)\n",
    "   - Cosmos DB: 1 account (Serverless or Provisioned)\n",
    "   - AI Search: 1 service (Basic or Standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure Permissions**: Contributor role on subscription or resource group\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Azure CLI**: Installed and configured (v2.50.0 or later)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Python Environment**:\n",
    "   - Python 3.8 or later\n",
    "   - pip package manager\n",
    "   - Virtual environment (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional but Recommended\n",
    "- **VS Code**: With Jupyter extension for notebook editing\n",
    "- **GitHub Codespaces**: Pre-configured environment with all tools\n",
    "- **Docker**: For running MCP servers locally\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook automatically detects your environment:\n",
    "- **GitHub Codespaces**: Auto-configures paths and settings\n",
    "- **Local (WSL/Linux)**: Uses local Azure CLI\n",
    "- **Local (Windows)**: Detects Windows paths\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Start Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**For first-time users:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose authentication method** (pick one):\n",
    "   - Option A: Service Principal → Run Cell 9, provide credentials when prompted\n",
    "   - Option B: Azure CLI → Run `az login` in terminal before Cell 1\n",
    "   - Option C: Managed Identity → No action needed if on Azure compute\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run cells in order**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Cell 3:  Environment Detection\n",
    "   Cell 5:  Bootstrap Configuration\n",
    "   Cell 7:  Install Dependencies (~5 min)\n",
    "   Cell 9:  Azure Authentication Setup\n",
    "   Cell 11: Load Helper Functions\n",
    "   Cell 14: Set Deployment Configuration\n",
    "   Cell 18: Deploy Infrastructure (~35 min)\n",
    "   Cell 21: Generate master-lab.env file\n",
    "   Cell 23: Reload Configuration\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify deployment**:\n",
    "   - Check Azure Portal for resources\n",
    "   - Ensure `master-lab.env` file exists\n",
    "   - Verify environment variables are loaded\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Proceed to labs**: Jump to [Lab 1: Access Control](#lab1-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Azure CLI not found\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Install Azure CLI from https://aka.ms/installazurecli\n",
    "- **Or**: Set `AZURE_CLI_PATH` environment variable to CLI location\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Please run 'az login'\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Run `az login` in terminal or set Service Principal credentials\n",
    "- **Check**: Run `az account show` to verify authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Insufficient quota for deployment\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Request quota increase in Azure Portal (Support → Quotas)\n",
    "- **Or**: Use different regions with available quota\n",
    "- **Note**: AI Services quota often needs increase for multiple deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Deployment timeout\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Azure deployments can take time; wait for completion\n",
    "- **Check**: View deployment status in Azure Portal → Resource Group → Deployments\n",
    "- **Retry**: Re-run the deployment cell (it's idempotent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Module not found\" errors\n",
    "- **Solution**: Run Cell 7 (Dependencies Install) completely\n",
    "- **Check**: Restart kernel after installing dependencies\n",
    "- **Verify**: Run `pip list | grep azure` to confirm packages installed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After Section 0 completes successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Verify deployment**: Check that all resources exist in Azure Portal\n",
    "2. **Review configuration**: Open `master-lab.env` to see all settings\n",
    "3. **Choose labs**: Pick from 12 comprehensive labs covering:\n",
    "   - Access Control (JWT and API keys)\n",
    "   - Load Balancing (multi-region)\n",
    "   - Semantic Caching (Redis + embeddings)\n",
    "   - Message Storing (Cosmos DB)\n",
    "   - Vector Search (AI Search + RAG)\n",
    "   - LLM Logging (Log Analytics)\n",
    "   - MCP Integration (Excel, Docs, GitHub, Weather)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Start learning**: Jump to any lab using the table of contents\n",
    "\n",

    "- Automatically discovers API IDs if not provided\n",
    "- Supports multiple policy applications in sequence\n",
    "- Uses REST API for broader CLI version compatibility\n",

    "**Purpose**: Alternative method to create AI Foundry (Azure AI Services) accounts using Bicep templates\n",

    "- Bicep templates compiled and ready\n",
    "- Service principal or Azure CLI authentication configured\n",

    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**This is an optional infrastructure-as-code deployment step.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Checks if Bicep Step 2 template exists (`deploy-02-foundries.bicep`)\n",
    "2. If found, deploys AI Foundry accounts for three regions:\n",
    "   - East US\n",
    "   - West US\n",
    "   - Sweden Central\n",
    "3. Each account supports multiple AI model deployments\n",
    "4. Uses ARM template deployment via Azure CLI or SDK\n",
    "5. Captures deployment outputs for subsequent configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This step can be skipped if AI Foundry accounts are created through other means (Portal, SDK, or the main deployment cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "The deployment typically takes 5-10 minutes per account.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "If Bicep file exists:\n",
    "- Deployment progress messages for each region\n",
    "- Confirmation of successful account creation\n",
    "- Output variables containing account endpoints and keys\n",

    "## 0.9 Access Controlling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Implement OAuth 2.0 based access control to restrict API access by user or client. This lab demonstrates how to use Azure AD (Entra ID) as an identity provider for fine-grained authorization on Azure OpenAI models through APIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization:** Configure identity provider-based authentication\n",
    "- **Token Acquisition:** Request tokens from Azure AD for authenticated API calls\n",
    "- **Bearer Tokens:** Include tokens in API requests for authorization\n",
    "- **Access Scopes:** Define granular permissions for different API endpoints\n",
    "- **Token Expiration:** Handle token refresh and expiration scenarios\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting:** Debug 401/403 errors and policy propagation delays\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Client application requests OAuth token from Azure AD\n",
    "2. Azure AD validates credentials and returns access token\n",
    "3. Client includes token in Authorization header (Bearer token)\n",
    "4. APIM policy validates token with Azure AD\n",
    "5. Policy checks token scope against API requirements\n",
    "6. Authorized requests proceed to backend Azure OpenAI\n",
    "7. Unauthorized requests return 403 Forbidden\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Azure AD application registration (created during deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Successful authentication with valid OAuth token\n",
    "- Requests with invalid/missing tokens receive 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "- Token-based access control enforced at APIM level\n",
    "- Can observe policy evaluation in APIM tracing\n",
    "- Different users can have different access levels\n",
    "- Token expiration properly handled with refresh\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Issues & Solutions\n",
    "| Issue | Solution |\n",
    "|-------|----------|\n",
    "| 401 Unauthorized | Wait 30-60 seconds for policy to propagate |\n",
    "| 500 Internal Server Error | Check backend health with Azure CLI |\n",
    "| Token not found | Run `az login` to authenticate |\n",
    "| Missing API Key | Verify APIM_API_KEY in environment variables |"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates OAuth 2.0 authentication using Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) bearer tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Azure CLI authenticated (`az login` completed)\n",
    "- APIM service deployed with JWT validation policy active\n",
    "- Environment variables loaded from `master-lab.env`:\n",
    "  - `APIM_GATEWAY_URL`\n",
    "  - `RESOURCE_GROUP`\n",
    "  - `APIM_SERVICE`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**This test demonstrates enterprise-grade authentication using Azure AD:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acquires Azure AD Token:**\n",
    "   - Uses Azure CLI to obtain a bearer token\n",
    "   - Token is scoped to Azure Cognitive Services\n",
    "   - Token represents the authenticated user's identity\n",
    "   - Token has limited lifetime (typically 1 hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Makes Authenticated API Request:**\n",
    "   - Sends POST request to APIM gateway\n",
    "   - Includes JWT token in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`\n",
    "   - Requests a simple chat completion from GPT-4\n",
    "   - Does NOT include API subscription key\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **APIM Policy Validation:**\n",
    "   - APIM validates the JWT token signature\n",
    "   - Checks token issuer, audience, and claims\n",
    "   - Ensures token hasn't expired\n",
    "   - Allows request if token is valid, returns 401 if invalid\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Handling:**\n",
    "   - Displays the AI-generated response if successful\n",
    "   - Shows error details if authentication fails\n",
    "   - Measures and displays response time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Benefits:**\n",
    "- No static API keys transmitted\n",
    "- Tokens are short-lived and rotatable\n",
    "- User identity can be tracked for audit logs\n",
    "- Fine-grained access control via Azure AD roles\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "When JWT policy is active:\n",
    "✅ **SUCCESS** - Request succeeds with 200 status code\n",
    "- Bearer token successfully validated by APIM\n",
    "- AI model response returned\n",
    "- Response time displayed\n",
    "\n",
    "When JWT policy is NOT active or token is invalid:\n",
    "❌ **FAIL** - Request fails with 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "- Error message indicating authentication failure\n",
    "- Details about token validation error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: JWT validation requires specific APIM policy configuration.\n",

    "### Test 4: Dual Authentication (JWT + API Key)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates using both JWT token and API subscription key simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Azure CLI authenticated\n",
    "- APIM subscription key available\n",
    "- APIM configured to accept both authentication methods\n",
    "- Environment variables from `master-lab.env`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Tests the most secure authentication pattern: defense in depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acquires Both Credentials:**\n",
    "   - JWT bearer token from Azure AD\n",
    "   - API subscription key from environment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sends Dual-Authenticated Request:**\n",
    "   - Authorization header: `Bearer <jwt_token>`\n",
    "   - Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header: `<api_key>`\n",
    "   - Both credentials included in same request\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **APIM Policy Behavior:**\n",
    "   - Can validate EITHER credential (OR logic)\n",
    "   - Can require BOTH credentials (AND logic)\n",
    "   - Configuration depends on policy design\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Migration scenarios (supporting both old and new auth)\n",
    "   - Defense in depth (multiple auth layers)\n",
    "   - Different auth for different operations\n",
    "   - Compliance requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:**\n",
    "Dual authentication provides maximum flexibility during transitions but should eventually converge to JWT-only for enterprise scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "✅ **SUCCESS** - Request succeeds with both credentials\n",
    "- APIM validates both authentication methods\n",
    "- Response shows successful authorization\n",
    "- Useful for migration and compliance scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Note:**\n",
    "In production, choose one primary authentication method for consistency.\n",

    "### 1.1.2 Apply Caching Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Applies the semantic caching policy to the APIM API\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Redis cache deployed and accessible\n",
    "- Embeddings backend configured (previous cell)\n",
    "- APIM service and API deployed\n",
    "- Policy XML file available\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Applies the semantic caching policy to enable intelligent caching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loads Policy XML:**\n",
    "   - Reads semantic caching policy from file\n",
    "   - Policy includes Redis connection strings\n",
    "   - Policy includes embeddings endpoint configuration\n",
    "   - Policy defines similarity threshold (e.g., 0.90 = 90% similar)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Policy Components:**\n",
    "   - **Inbound**: Generates embeddings for incoming query\n",
    "   - **Inbound**: Searches Redis for similar cached queries\n",
    "   - **Inbound**: Returns cached response if similarity > threshold\n",
    "   - **Outbound**: Stores new responses with embeddings in Redis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Redis host and password from environment\n",
    "   - Embeddings endpoint and key from environment\n",
    "   - Similarity threshold (adjustable)\n",
    "   - Cache TTL (time-to-live)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applies Policy:**\n",
    "   - Uses APIM REST API to update API policy\n",
    "   - Validates XML syntax\n",
    "   - Activates policy immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "- First request: Generate embeddings → Call AI model → Cache with embeddings\n",
    "- Similar request: Generate embeddings → Find similar in cache → Return cached response (fast!)\n",
    "- Dissimilar request: No cache hit → Call AI model → Cache new response\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "- Policy XML loaded successfully\n",
    "- Policy applied to APIM API\n",
    "- Semantic caching now active\n",
    "- Confirmation message showing policy activation\n",
    "- Ready to test semantic caching performance\n",

    "### 1.1.5 Redis Cache Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Displays Redis cache statistics and metrics for monitoring caching effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Redis cache accessible\n",
    "- Redis connection string from environment\n",
    "- Redis Python client library (redis-py)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Retrieves and displays Redis cache statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cache Metrics:**\n",
    "   - Total keys stored\n",
    "   - Memory usage\n",
    "   - Cache hit rate\n",
    "   - Eviction statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantic Cache Specific:**\n",
    "   - Number of cached query embeddings\n",
    "   - Storage per embedding\n",
    "   - TTL (time-to-live) settings\n",
    "   - Expiration policy\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Insights:**\n",
    "   - Shows how cache is filling up\n",
    "   - Identifies optimal similarity threshold\n",
    "   - Helps tune cache size\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitoring:**\n",
    "   - Track cache effectiveness over time\n",
    "   - Identify when to scale Redis\n",
    "   - Optimize cache eviction policies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Capacity planning\n",
    "- Cost optimization\n",
    "- Performance tuning\n",
    "- Debugging cache issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "Redis statistics display:\n",
    "- Total cached items: <number>\n",

    "## 1.2 Message Storing with Cosmos DB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Build a persistent audit trail of all LLM interactions by storing prompts, completions, and token metrics in Cosmos DB. This lab demonstrates a data pipeline from APIM logging through Event Hub to long-term storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Built-in LLM Logging:** Capture prompts and completions automatically\n",
    "- **Event Hub Integration:** Stream logging data to Event Hub\n",
    "- **Stream Analytics:** Process and transform log data in flight\n",
    "- **Cosmos DB Storage:** Persist structured interaction data\n",
    "- **Document Querying:** Query stored interactions for audit and analysis\n",
    "- **Data Pipeline:** Understand full flow from API to persistent storage\n",
    "- **Scalable Architecture:** Handle high-volume LLM interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. User request processed by APIM\n",
    "2. Built-in logging captures prompt, completion, and metadata\n",
    "3. Logs sent to Azure Monitor\n",
    "4. Diagnostic settings export logs to Event Hub\n",
    "5. Stream Analytics consumes Event Hub messages\n",
    "6. Analytics transforms and enriches message data\n",
    "7. Data written to Cosmos DB for long-term storage\n",
    "8. Applications query Cosmos DB for interaction history\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow Diagram\n",
    "```\n",
    "[APIM] → [Azure Monitor] → [Event Hub] → [Stream Analytics] → [Cosmos DB]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Cosmos DB account (created during deployment)\n",
    "- Event Hub namespace (created during deployment)\n",
    "- Stream Analytics job (created during deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Prompts and completions logged to Azure Monitor\n",
    "- Logs appear in Event Hub within seconds\n",
    "- Stream Analytics job processes and transforms data\n",
    "- Documents appear in Cosmos DB within 1-2 minutes\n",
    "- Can query stored interactions by user, timestamp, model\n",
    "- Audit trail shows complete interaction history\n",
    "- Token metrics aggregated and stored\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Cosmos DB Query\n",
    "```kusto\n",
    "SELECT c.user_id, c.prompt, c.completion, c.token_count, c.timestamp\n",
    "FROM messages c\n",
    "WHERE c.timestamp > GetCurrentTimestamp() - 3600\n",
    "ORDER BY c.timestamp DESC\n",

    "     \"metadata\": {}\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Compliance and auditing\n",
    "   - Conversation history\n",
    "   - User behavior analysis\n",
    "   - Quality assurance\n",
    "   - Training data collection\n",
    "   - Cost tracking per user\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compliance Benefits:**\n",
    "   - Complete audit trail\n",
    "   - Searchable conversation history\n",
    "   - Retention policy enforcement\n",
    "   - PII handling and redaction support\n",

    "## 1.3 Vector Searching with RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance Azure OpenAI responses with current information from a knowledge base. This lab demonstrates how to search vector embeddings in Azure AI Search and augment LLM responses with retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Vector Embeddings:** Convert documents and queries to embeddings\n",
    "- **Azure AI Search:** Index and search documents using vector similarity\n",
    "- **RAG Pattern:** Combine retrieval with generative AI for accurate responses\n",
    "- **Prompt Augmentation:** Add retrieved context to LLM prompts\n",
    "- **End-to-End Flow:** From document ingestion through response generation\n",
    "- **APIM Gateway:** Route embedding and search requests through APIM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Knowledge base documents uploaded and indexed in Azure AI Search\n",
    "2. Each document chunked and embedded using text-embedding-3-small\n",
    "3. Vector embeddings stored in AI Search index\n",
    "4. User asks question to APIM gateway\n",
    "5. Question embedded using same embedding model\n",
    "6. AI Search performs vector similarity search\n",
    "7. Top matching documents retrieved and ranked\n",
    "8. Retrieved documents added to LLM prompt as context\n",
    "9. Azure OpenAI generates response augmented with retrieved information\n",
    "10. Response returned to user with source attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Documents] → [Chunking] → [Embedding] → [AI Search Index]\n",
    "                                              ↓\n",
    "[User Query] → [Embedding] → [Vector Search] → [Top Results]\n",
    "                                                    ↓\n",
    "[Context + Query] → [Azure OpenAI] → [Augmented Response]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor permissions\n",
    "- Azure AI Search instance (created during deployment)\n",
    "- Sample documents for knowledge base\n",
    "- text-embedding-3-small model access\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Documents successfully indexed with embeddings\n",
    "- Vector search returns relevant documents\n",
    "- Retrieved context properly formatted for LLM\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI generates contextually accurate responses\n",
    "- Source documents attributed in responses\n",
    "- Search relevance improves with better document chunking\n",
    "- Response quality enhanced by augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Metrics\n",
    "- Embedding generation latency: <1 second per query\n",
    "- Vector search latency: <500ms\n",
    "- Response generation: 2-5 seconds depending on context\n",
    "- Accuracy: Measured by user satisfaction with RAG responses"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Indexes sample documents in Azure AI Search with embeddings for vector search and RAG patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Azure AI Search deployed (from infrastructure)\n",
    "- Environment variables: `AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`, `AI_SEARCH_KEY`\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI embeddings endpoint configured\n",
    "- Search index created (from Step 1.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Indexes sample documents with vector embeddings for semantic search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepares Sample Documents:**\n",
    "   - Creates sample documents about various topics\n",
    "   - Each document has: id, title, content, metadata\n",
    "   - Documents cover diverse domains for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generates Embeddings:**\n",
    "   - Sends each document's content to Azure OpenAI embeddings API\n",
    "   - Uses text-embedding-ada-002 model\n",
    "   - Generates 1536-dimension vectors\n",
    "   - Embeddings capture semantic meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Uploads to AI Search:**\n",
    "   - Creates/updates search index with vector field\n",
    "   - Configures vector search algorithm (HNSW)\n",
    "   - Uploads documents with embeddings\n",
    "   - Enables hybrid search (keyword + vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Index Configuration:**\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     \"fields\": [\n",
    "       {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"Edm.String\", \"key\": true},\n",

    "       {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"Edm.String\", \"searchable\": true},\n",
    "       {\"name\": \"contentVector\", \"type\": \"Collection(Edm.Single)\",\n",
    "        \"dimensions\": 1536, \"vectorSearchProfile\": \"vector-profile\"}\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Vector Search Benefits:**\n",
    "   - Semantic similarity search (not just keyword matching)\n",
    "   - Finds conceptually related documents\n",
    "   - Better for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n",
    "   - Handles synonyms and paraphrasing naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Documents Indexed:**\n",
    "- Technical documentation\n",
    "- Product descriptions\n",
    "- FAQ entries\n",

    "Understand multi-region Azure OpenAI deployment patterns by implementing backend pool load balancing. This lab demonstrates a typical prioritized PTU (Provisioned Throughput Units) with fallback consumption scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Backend Pool Configuration:** Define priority-based routing rules in APIM\n",
    "- **Load Distribution:** Understand how requests route across multiple endpoints\n",
    "- **Failover Behavior:** See graceful degradation when backends reach capacity\n",
    "- **Priority-Based Routing:** Configure primary (Priority 1) and fallback (Priority 2) endpoints\n",
    "- **Monitoring:** Track request distribution and backend health\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Client requests arrive at APIM gateway\n",
    "2. APIM evaluates backend pool configuration\n",
    "3. Priority 1 backend (highest priority PTU) receives requests first\n",
    "4. When Priority 1 is exhausted or unavailable, requests failover to Priority 2 backends\n",
    "5. Multiple Priority 2 backends are load-balanced equally\n",
    "6. Metrics show distribution of requests across backends\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Observe load distribution patterns in metrics\n",
    "- See Priority 1 backend exhaustion after threshold is reached\n",
    "- Confirm automatic failover to Priority 2 backends\n",
    "- Verify equal load distribution among Priority 2 endpoints\n",
    "- Response times remain consistent despite failover"

    "#### Objective\n",
    "Implement comprehensive observability for your AI gateway by emitting token consumption metrics to Application Insights. Track LLM token usage (prompt, completion, and total tokens) to monitor costs and capacity planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Token Metrics Policy:** Configure APIM to emit token metrics\n",
    "- **Cost Monitoring:** Track prompt tokens, completion tokens, and total tokens consumed\n",
    "- **Application Insights Integration:** Send metrics for centralized monitoring\n",
    "- **Response Streaming:** Support for OpenAI streaming responses while tracking tokens\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting:** Use tracing tools to verify metric emission\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Request arrives at APIM with Azure OpenAI headers\n",
    "2. Policy extracts token counts from responses\n",
    "3. Categorizes tokens: Prompt Tokens, Completion Tokens, Total Tokens\n",
    "4. Emits custom metrics to Application Insights\n",
    "5. Metrics can be queried and visualized in dashboards\n",
    "6. Supports streaming responses by aggregating token counts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Application Insights instance (created during deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Metrics appear in Application Insights within 2-5 minutes\n",
    "- Custom metric \"LLM-Tokens\" shows prompt, completion, and total token counts\n",
    "- Can create alerts based on token thresholds\n",
    "- Streaming responses properly track all tokens\n",
    "- Can use KQL queries to analyze token patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Configuration\n",
    "- Policy name: `azure-openai-emit-token-metric`\n",
    "- Supported endpoints: Azure OpenAI Chat Completion, Completion APIs\n",
    "- Metrics update in real-time as requests complete"

    "#### Objective\n",
    "Integrate Azure AI Foundry SDK with your APIM gateway to route all LLM requests through the API gateway while using native AI Foundry development patterns. This lab demonstrates how to configure the SDK to use APIM as the underlying Azure OpenAI endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **AI Foundry SDK:** Use Python SDK for AI Foundry projects\n",
    "- **Connection Configuration:** Configure Azure OpenAI connections with APIM endpoint\n",
    "- **Gateway Routing:** Route SDK requests through APIM automatically\n",
    "- **Model Catalog:** Access AI Foundry model catalog through APIM\n",
    "- **Policy Application:** All APIM policies apply to SDK requests\n",
    "- **Authentication:** Handle credentials seamlessly with APIM integration\n",
    "- **Development Patterns:** Use native SDK patterns with gateway benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Developer creates Azure AI Foundry project with AI Foundry SDK\n",
    "2. AI Foundry project has OpenAI connection configured\n",
    "3. OpenAI connection specifies APIM endpoint as the provider\n",
    "4. Developer uses standard AI Foundry SDK code\n",
    "5. SDK requests go to APIM instead of direct Azure OpenAI\n",
    "6. APIM applies all configured policies:\n",
    "   - Load balancing\n",
    "   - Rate limiting\n",
    "   - Content safety\n",
    "   - Token metrics\n",
    "   - Semantic caching\n",
    "   - Logging\n",
    "7. Requests forwarded to backend Azure OpenAI\n",
    "8. Responses returned through APIM to application\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor permissions\n",
    "- AI Foundry project created\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI connection configured with APIM endpoint\n",
    "- APIM subscription key configured\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- AI Foundry SDK initializes successfully\n",
    "- Requests are routed through APIM (visible in APIM logs)\n",
    "- Chat completions work through SDK\n",
    "- All APIM policies apply to SDK requests\n",
    "- Can track SDK usage in APIM analytics\n",
    "- No code changes needed to use APIM gateway\n",
    "- Token metrics appear in Application Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection Configuration Format\n",
    "```\n",
    "Provider: Azure OpenAI\n",
    "Endpoint: https://{APIM_GATEWAY}.azure-api.net\n",
    "Key: {APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}\n",
    "API Version: 2024-08-01-preview\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Benefits\n",
    "1. **Centralized Governance:** All AI Foundry SDK requests through APIM policies\n",
    "2. **Unified Monitoring:** Track all interactions in one place\n",
    "3. **Multi-Region Support:** APIM load balancing benefits\n",
    "4. **Cost Control:** Token metrics and rate limiting\n",
    "5. **Security:** All APIM security policies applied"

      "### Key Steps for MCP Server Publishing:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preparation of the Application:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that your application is ready to be deployed.\n",
      "   - Confirm that all configurations, dependencies, and environment variables are set correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Set Up the MCP Environment:**\n",
      "   - Access the MCP management portal.\n",
      "   - Create or select a project within the MCP that will host your application.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Define and Configure Resources:**\n",
      "   - Choose the appropriate server resources (e.g., instances, databases) needed for your application.\n",
      "   - Configure networking settings such as firewalls, subnets, and load balancers.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Deploy Application:**\n",
      "   - Use available tools (such as CI/CD pipelines) for the deployment of your application.\n",
      "   - Upload your codebase to the MCP instance or container.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Configuration of Runtime Environment:**\n",
      "   - Adjust settings for the runtime environment (like virtual environments, Docker configurations, etc.).\n",
      "   - Ensure that the application can access necessary services and APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Testing:**\n",
      "   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure everything works as expected in the new environment.\n",
      "   - Perform both automated and manual testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Monitoring Setup:**\n",
      "   - Implement monitoring and logging to keep track of application health and performance.\n",
      "   - Set up alerts for potential issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Publish Application:**\n",
      "   - Make your application live by updating DNS records and configuring load balancers if necessary.\n",
      "   - Confirm that users can access the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Post-Publishing Review:**\n",
      "   - Monitor the application for any issues after going live.\n",
      "   - Gather user feedback and perform performance tuning as required.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Documentation:**\n",
      "    - Maintain documentation for deployment processes, configurations, and troubleshooting for future reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "These steps may vary depending on the specific MCP provider and the nature of your application. Always refer to the provider's official documentation for detailed instructions tailored to their platform.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates accessing OpenWeather API through APIM as an MCP-style data source\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- APIM deployed with Weather API configured\n",
    "- OpenWeather API key configured\n",
    "- Environment variables: `APIM_WEATHER_URL`, `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`\n",

    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Accesses weather data through APIM gateway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weather API Features:**\n",
    "   - Current weather for any city\n",
    "   - Multi-day forecasts\n",
    "   - Weather alerts\n",
    "   - Historical weather data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **APIM Benefits:**\n",
    "   - Hides actual API key from clients\n",
    "   - Applies rate limiting\n",
    "   - Caches weather responses\n",
    "   - Transforms response format\n",
    "   - Logs all weather queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Queries:**\n",
    "   - Current weather in Seattle\n",
    "   - 5-day forecast for Paris\n",
    "   - Weather alerts for region\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integration with AI:**\n",
    "   - AI can call weather API via function calling\n",
    "   - Natural language: \"What's the weather in Tokyo?\"\n",
    "   - AI extracts city name and calls API\n",
    "   - Returns formatted weather info\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates using APIM as a unified gateway for both AI models and traditional APIs.\n",

    "#### Objective\n",
    "Integrate GitHub repository access through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to enable Azure OpenAI to read and analyze repository content. This lab demonstrates how to query GitHub repositories, list files, and retrieve content programmatically through APIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **MCP Server Integration:** Connect to GitHub API via MCP protocol\n",
    "- **Repository Navigation:** Browse files and directory structures\n",
    "- **Content Retrieval:** Fetch file contents for analysis\n",
    "- **HTTP-Based MCP:** Use REST API to communicate with MCP servers\n",
    "- **APIM Routing:** Route MCP requests through APIM gateway\n",
    "- **Authentication:** Manage GitHub API credentials securely\n",
    "- **Data Processing:** Feed repository data to Azure OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Azure OpenAI needs to access GitHub repository data\n",
    "2. Function call requests GitHub repository MCP server via APIM\n",
    "3. MCP server receives request through `/mcp/` HTTP endpoint\n",
    "4. Server authenticates with GitHub API using configured credentials\n",
    "5. Server executes tool (list files, read content, etc.)\n",
    "6. Response returned to APIM\n",
    "7. APIM proxies response back to Azure OpenAI\n",
    "8. Azure OpenAI processes repository data and generates analysis\n",
    "9. Final response returned to user\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Azure OpenAI] → [APIM Gateway] → [GitHub MCP Server] → [GitHub API]\n",
    "     ↓                                    ↓\n",
    "  Response ← [Tool Result] ← [File Content] ← [GitHub]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor permissions\n",
    "- GitHub Account with repository access\n",
    "- GitHub personal access token (for API authentication)\n",
    "- MCP servers initialized (Cell 11)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Successfully list files in GitHub repository\n",
    "- Retrieve file contents from repository\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI can access repository structure\n",
    "- Function calls to GitHub MCP work through APIM\n",
    "- Responses properly formatted for LLM consumption\n",
    "- Can analyze repository structure and content\n",
    "- Performance metrics show latency through APIM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MCP Server Configuration\n",
    "```\n",
    "Protocol: HTTP POST\n",
    "Endpoint: https://{mcp-server}/mcp/\n",
    "Authentication: GitHub Personal Access Token\n",
    "Supported Tools:\n",
    "  - list_repository_files\n",
    "  - read_file_content\n",
    "  - get_repository_info\n",
    "  - search_files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Use Cases\n",
    "1. **Code Review:** Analyze code structure and patterns\n",
    "2. **Documentation Generation:** Create docs from code\n",
    "3. **Dependency Analysis:** Understand project dependencies\n",
    "4. **Architecture Understanding:** Map codebase structure"

    "## 3.5 Built-in LLM Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Enable comprehensive observability of all LLM interactions through APIM's built-in logging capabilities. Automatically capture prompts, completions, and token consumption to Azure Monitor for compliance, debugging, and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Built-in Logging:** Configure APIM to automatically log LLM interactions\n",
    "- **Azure Monitor Integration:** Send logs to Azure Monitor for centralized analysis\n",
    "- **KQL Queries:** Write queries to analyze prompt and completion patterns\n",
    "- **Token Tracking:** Monitor token consumption across all requests\n",
    "- **Diagnostic Settings:** Route logs to Log Analytics, Event Hub, and Storage\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting:** Debug issues using detailed interaction logs\n",
    "- **Compliance:** Maintain audit trails for regulatory requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Request arrives at APIM with user prompt\n",
    "2. Built-in logging policy captures full request/response\n",
    "3. Extracts: prompt text, completion text, token counts\n",
    "4. Logs sent to Azure Monitor Diagnostic Logs\n",
    "5. Logs routed to:\n",
    "   - Log Analytics workspace for querying\n",
    "   - Event Hub for real-time streaming\n",
    "   - Storage account for long-term archival\n",
    "6. Can create alerts based on log patterns\n",
    "7. Dashboards visualize logging metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Log Analytics workspace (created during deployment)\n",
    "- APIM diagnostic settings configured\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- All API requests logged to Azure Monitor\n",
    "- Prompts and completions captured in full detail\n",
    "- Token counts tracked for cost analysis\n",
    "- Can query logs using KQL within 2-5 minutes\n",
    "- Logs appear in configured destinations (Log Analytics, Event Hub, etc.)\n",
    "- Can search logs by user, timestamp, model, or response status\n",
    "- Dashboards show real-time logging metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample KQL Query\n",
    "```kusto\n",

    "#### Key Monitored Data\n",
    "- Prompt text (first 500 characters)\n",
    "- Completion text (first 1000 characters)\n",
    "- Total tokens, prompt tokens, completion tokens\n",
    "- Request/response status codes\n",
    "- Backend latency\n",
