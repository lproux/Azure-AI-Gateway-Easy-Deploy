    "\n",
    "## Authentication Options\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook supports three authentication methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Service Principal (Recommended for Automation)\n",
    "Best for: CI/CD, automation, production deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create service principal\n",
    "az ad sp create-for-rbac --name \"ai-gateway-sp\" --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set environment variables (done automatically by Cell 9)\n",
    "export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=\"<client-id>\"\n",
    "export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=\"<client-secret>\"\n",
    "export AZURE_TENANT_ID=\"<tenant-id>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Non-interactive (no browser login required)\n",
    "- Works in automated environments\n",
    "- Reproducible deployments\n",
    "- Can be used in CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Service principal created with Contributor role\n",

    "- No secrets to manage\n",
    "- Automatic credential rotation\n",
    "- Highest security posture\n",
    "- Works seamlessly on Azure compute\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Notebook running on Azure compute resource\n",
    "- Managed identity assigned to the resource\n",
    "- Identity has necessary Azure roles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: Azure CLI Login (Recommended for Interactive Development)\n",
    "Best for: Local development, learning, testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Login interactively\n",
    "az login\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select subscription (if you have multiple)\n",
    "az account set --subscription \"subscription-name-or-id\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Simplest for local development\n",
    "- Uses your personal Azure credentials\n",
    "- No additional setup required\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed locally\n",
    "- User account with sufficient permissions (Contributor role)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running Section 0, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required\n",
    "1. **Azure Subscription** with sufficient quota:\n",
    "   - API Management: 1 instance (Developer or Premium tier)\n",
    "   - AI Services: 3 accounts (S0 tier)\n",
    "   - Redis Cache: 1 instance (Basic or Standard)\n",
    "   - Cosmos DB: 1 account (Serverless or Provisioned)\n",
    "   - AI Search: 1 service (Basic or Standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure Permissions**: Contributor role on subscription or resource group\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Azure CLI**: Installed and configured (v2.50.0 or later)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Python Environment**:\n",
    "   - Python 3.8 or later\n",
    "   - pip package manager\n",
    "   - Virtual environment (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional but Recommended\n",
    "- **VS Code**: With Jupyter extension for notebook editing\n",
    "- **GitHub Codespaces**: Pre-configured environment with all tools\n",
    "- **Docker**: For running MCP servers locally\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook automatically detects your environment:\n",
    "- **GitHub Codespaces**: Auto-configures paths and settings\n",
    "- **Local (WSL/Linux)**: Uses local Azure CLI\n",
    "- **Local (Windows)**: Detects Windows paths\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Start Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**For first-time users:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose authentication method** (pick one):\n",
    "   - Option A: Service Principal → Run Cell 9, provide credentials when prompted\n",
    "   - Option B: Azure CLI → Run `az login` in terminal before Cell 1\n",
    "   - Option C: Managed Identity → No action needed if on Azure compute\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run cells in order**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Cell 3:  Environment Detection\n",
    "   Cell 5:  Bootstrap Configuration\n",
    "   Cell 7:  Install Dependencies (~5 min)\n",
    "   Cell 9:  Azure Authentication Setup\n",
    "   Cell 11: Load Helper Functions\n",
    "   Cell 14: Set Deployment Configuration\n",
    "   Cell 18: Deploy Infrastructure (~35 min)\n",
    "   Cell 21: Generate master-lab.env file\n",
    "   Cell 23: Reload Configuration\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify deployment**:\n",
    "   - Check Azure Portal for resources\n",
    "   - Ensure `master-lab.env` file exists\n",
    "   - Verify environment variables are loaded\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Proceed to labs**: Jump to [Lab 1: Access Control](#lab1-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Azure CLI not found\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Install Azure CLI from https://aka.ms/installazurecli\n",
    "- **Or**: Set `AZURE_CLI_PATH` environment variable to CLI location\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Please run 'az login'\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Run `az login` in terminal or set Service Principal credentials\n",
    "- **Check**: Run `az account show` to verify authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Insufficient quota for deployment\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Request quota increase in Azure Portal (Support → Quotas)\n",
    "- **Or**: Use different regions with available quota\n",
    "- **Note**: AI Services quota often needs increase for multiple deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Deployment timeout\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Azure deployments can take time; wait for completion\n",
    "- **Check**: View deployment status in Azure Portal → Resource Group → Deployments\n",
    "- **Retry**: Re-run the deployment cell (it's idempotent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Module not found\" errors\n",
    "- **Solution**: Run Cell 7 (Dependencies Install) completely\n",
    "- **Check**: Restart kernel after installing dependencies\n",
    "- **Verify**: Run `pip list | grep azure` to confirm packages installed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After Section 0 completes successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Verify deployment**: Check that all resources exist in Azure Portal\n",
    "2. **Review configuration**: Open `master-lab.env` to see all settings\n",
    "3. **Choose labs**: Pick from 12 comprehensive labs covering:\n",
    "   - Access Control (JWT and API keys)\n",
    "   - Load Balancing (multi-region)\n",
    "   - Semantic Caching (Redis + embeddings)\n",
    "   - Message Storing (Cosmos DB)\n",
    "   - Vector Search (AI Search + RAG)\n",
    "   - LLM Logging (Log Analytics)\n",
    "   - MCP Integration (Excel, Docs, GitHub, Weather)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Start learning**: Jump to any lab using the table of contents\n",
    "\n",

    "- `compile_bicep(bicep_path)` - Compiles Bicep templates to ARM JSON\n",
    "- `deploy_template(rg, name, template_file, params)` - Deploys ARM templates\n",
    "- `get_deployment_outputs(rg, name)` - Retrieves deployment outputs\n",

    "- `apply_policies(policies)` - Applies API Management policies via Azure REST API\n",
    "- Automatically discovers API IDs if not provided\n",
    "- Supports multiple policy applications in sequence\n",
    "- Uses REST API for broader CLI version compatibility\n",

    "## 0.9 Access Controlling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Implement OAuth 2.0 based access control to restrict API access by user or client. This lab demonstrates how to use Azure AD (Entra ID) as an identity provider for fine-grained authorization on Azure OpenAI models through APIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization:** Configure identity provider-based authentication\n",
    "- **Token Acquisition:** Request tokens from Azure AD for authenticated API calls\n",
    "- **Bearer Tokens:** Include tokens in API requests for authorization\n",
    "- **Access Scopes:** Define granular permissions for different API endpoints\n",
    "- **Token Expiration:** Handle token refresh and expiration scenarios\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting:** Debug 401/403 errors and policy propagation delays\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Client application requests OAuth token from Azure AD\n",
    "2. Azure AD validates credentials and returns access token\n",
    "3. Client includes token in Authorization header (Bearer token)\n",
    "4. APIM policy validates token with Azure AD\n",
    "5. Policy checks token scope against API requirements\n",
    "6. Authorized requests proceed to backend Azure OpenAI\n",
    "7. Unauthorized requests return 403 Forbidden\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Azure AD application registration (created during deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Successful authentication with valid OAuth token\n",
    "- Requests with invalid/missing tokens receive 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "- Token-based access control enforced at APIM level\n",
    "- Can observe policy evaluation in APIM tracing\n",
    "- Different users can have different access levels\n",
    "- Token expiration properly handled with refresh\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Issues & Solutions\n",
    "| Issue | Solution |\n",
    "|-------|----------|\n",
    "| 401 Unauthorized | Wait 30-60 seconds for policy to propagate |\n",
    "| 500 Internal Server Error | Check backend health with Azure CLI |\n",
    "| Token not found | Run `az login` to authenticate |\n",
    "| Missing API Key | Verify APIM_API_KEY in environment variables |"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates OAuth 2.0 authentication using Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) bearer tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Azure CLI authenticated (`az login` completed)\n",
    "- APIM service deployed with JWT validation policy active\n",
    "- Environment variables loaded from `master-lab.env`:\n",
    "  - `APIM_GATEWAY_URL`\n",
    "  - `RESOURCE_GROUP`\n",
    "  - `APIM_SERVICE`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**This test demonstrates enterprise-grade authentication using Azure AD:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acquires Azure AD Token:**\n",
    "   - Uses Azure CLI to obtain a bearer token\n",
    "   - Token is scoped to Azure Cognitive Services\n",
    "   - Token represents the authenticated user's identity\n",
    "   - Token has limited lifetime (typically 1 hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Makes Authenticated API Request:**\n",
    "   - Sends POST request to APIM gateway\n",
    "   - Includes JWT token in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`\n",
    "   - Requests a simple chat completion from GPT-4\n",
    "   - Does NOT include API subscription key\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **APIM Policy Validation:**\n",
    "   - APIM validates the JWT token signature\n",
    "   - Checks token issuer, audience, and claims\n",
    "   - Ensures token hasn't expired\n",
    "   - Allows request if token is valid, returns 401 if invalid\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Handling:**\n",
    "   - Displays the AI-generated response if successful\n",
    "   - Shows error details if authentication fails\n",
    "   - Measures and displays response time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Benefits:**\n",
    "- No static API keys transmitted\n",
    "- Tokens are short-lived and rotatable\n",
    "- User identity can be tracked for audit logs\n",
    "- Fine-grained access control via Azure AD roles\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "When JWT policy is active:\n",
    "✅ **SUCCESS** - Request succeeds with 200 status code\n",
    "- Bearer token successfully validated by APIM\n",
    "- AI model response returned\n",
    "- Response time displayed\n",
    "\n",
    "When JWT policy is NOT active or token is invalid:\n",
    "❌ **FAIL** - Request fails with 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "- Error message indicating authentication failure\n",
    "- Details about token validation error\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates using both JWT token and API subscription key simultaneously\n",

    "\n",

    "- APIM subscription key available\n",

    "- Environment variables from `master-lab.env`\n",

    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Tests the most secure authentication pattern: defense in depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acquires Both Credentials:**\n",
    "   - JWT bearer token from Azure AD\n",
    "   - API subscription key from environment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sends Dual-Authenticated Request:**\n",
    "   - Authorization header: `Bearer <jwt_token>`\n",
    "   - Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header: `<api_key>`\n",
    "   - Both credentials included in same request\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **APIM Policy Behavior:**\n",
    "   - Can validate EITHER credential (OR logic)\n",
    "   - Can require BOTH credentials (AND logic)\n",
    "   - Configuration depends on policy design\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Migration scenarios (supporting both old and new auth)\n",
    "   - Defense in depth (multiple auth layers)\n",
    "   - Different auth for different operations\n",
    "   - Compliance requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:**\n",
    "Dual authentication provides maximum flexibility during transitions but should eventually converge to JWT-only for enterprise scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "✅ **SUCCESS** - Request succeeds with both credentials\n",
    "- APIM validates both authentication methods\n",
    "- Response shows successful authorization\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Tests traditional API key-based authentication without JWT token\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- APIM subscription key from `master-lab.env`\n",
    "- API key validation policy configured in APIM\n",
    "- No Azure CLI login required (key-based auth is standalone)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Tests the traditional API Management authentication method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uses API Subscription Key Only:**\n",
    "   - No JWT token acquired\n",
    "   - Relies solely on `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header\n",
    "   - Simpler authentication pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Makes API Request:**\n",
    "   - POST to APIM gateway\n",
    "   - Only subscription key for authentication\n",
    "   - Requests chat completion\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **APIM Validation:**\n",
    "   - Checks if subscription key is valid\n",
    "   - Checks if subscription is active\n",
    "   - Checks rate limits and quotas\n",
    "   - Allows access if key is valid\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **When to Use API Keys:**\n",
    "   - Simple applications without Azure AD\n",
    "   - Legacy applications\n",
    "   - Development and testing\n",
    "   - Non-enterprise scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Considerations:**\n",
    "- API keys are long-lived (don't expire automatically)\n",
    "- Keys must be rotated manually\n",
    "- Keys should be stored securely (Key Vault, environment variables)\n",
    "- Less secure than JWT tokens for enterprise use\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "When API key policy is active:\n",
    "✅ **SUCCESS** - Request succeeds\n",
    "- API key validated by APIM\n",
    "- Chat completion response returned\n",
    "- Simpler than JWT authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "When API key policy is NOT active:\n",
    "❌ **FAIL** - Request fails with 401\n",
    "- APIM requires different authentication method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This is the simplest authentication method but least secure for production.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Loads Policy XML:**\n",
    "   - Reads semantic caching policy from file\n",
    "   - Policy includes Redis connection strings\n",
    "   - Policy includes embeddings endpoint configuration\n",
    "   - Policy defines similarity threshold (e.g., 0.90 = 90% similar)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Policy Components:**\n",
    "   - **Inbound**: Generates embeddings for incoming query\n",
    "   - **Inbound**: Searches Redis for similar cached queries\n",
    "   - **Inbound**: Returns cached response if similarity > threshold\n",
    "   - **Outbound**: Stores new responses with embeddings in Redis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Redis host and password from environment\n",

    "   - Similarity threshold (adjustable)\n",
    "   - Cache TTL (time-to-live)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applies Policy:**\n",
    "   - Uses APIM REST API to update API policy\n",
    "   - Validates XML syntax\n",
    "   - Activates policy immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",

    "### 1.1.3 Performance Test\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Tests semantic caching performance by sending similar queries and measuring response times\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Semantic caching policy applied (previous cell)\n",
    "- OpenAI client configured\n",
    "- APIM gateway accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Runs a comprehensive test of semantic caching performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test Queries:**\n",
    "   - Original: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "   - Similar variations:\n",
    "     * \"Tell me the capital of France\"\n",
    "     * \"What's the French capital city?\"\n",
    "     * \"Capital of France?\"\n",
    "   - Each variation is semantically similar but textually different\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Measurement:**\n",
    "   - Sends first query (cache miss) → measures time\n",
    "   - Sends variations (cache hits) → measures time for each\n",
    "   - Compares cache hit vs cache miss latency\n",
    "   - Calculates speedup factor\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expected Results:**\n",
    "   - First query: ~500-2000ms (full AI model call)\n",
    "   - Cached queries: ~50-200ms (Redis retrieval)\n",
    "   - Speedup: 5-20x faster for cache hits\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Similarity Testing:**\n",
    "   - Tests different similarity thresholds\n",
    "   - Shows which queries match the cache\n",
    "   - Demonstrates semantic understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Metrics Collected:**\n",
    "   - Response time for each query\n",
    "   - Cache hit/miss status\n",
    "   - Similarity scores\n",
    "   - Speedup percentages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "Performance comparison table showing:\n",
    "- Query variations tested\n",
    "- Response time for each query\n",
    "- Cache hit/miss status\n",
    "- Speedup compared to first query\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "| Query                            | Time (ms) | Status      | Speedup |\n",
    "|----------------------------------|-----------|-------------|---------|\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Displays Redis cache statistics and metrics for monitoring caching effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Redis cache accessible\n",
    "- Redis connection string from environment\n",
    "- Redis Python client library (redis-py)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Retrieves and displays Redis cache statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cache Metrics:**\n",
    "   - Total keys stored\n",
    "   - Memory usage\n",
    "   - Cache hit rate\n",
    "   - Eviction statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantic Cache Specific:**\n",
    "   - Number of cached query embeddings\n",
    "   - Storage per embedding\n",
    "   - TTL (time-to-live) settings\n",
    "   - Expiration policy\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Insights:**\n",
    "   - Shows how cache is filling up\n",
    "   - Identifies optimal similarity threshold\n",
    "   - Helps tune cache size\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitoring:**\n",
    "   - Track cache effectiveness over time\n",
    "   - Identify when to scale Redis\n",
    "   - Optimize cache eviction policies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Capacity planning\n",
    "- Cost optimization\n",
    "- Performance tuning\n",
    "- Debugging cache issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "Redis statistics display:\n",
    "- Total cached items: <number>\n",
    "- Memory used: <MB>\n",
    "- Cache hit rate: <%>\n",
    "- Average embedding size: <bytes>\n",
    "- Oldest cached item: <timestamp>\n",
    "- Newest cached item: <timestamp>\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps operators understand cache utilization and effectiveness.\n",

    "## 1.2 Message Storing with Cosmos DB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Build a persistent audit trail of all LLM interactions by storing prompts, completions, and token metrics in Cosmos DB. This lab demonstrates a data pipeline from APIM logging through Event Hub to long-term storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Built-in LLM Logging:** Capture prompts and completions automatically\n",
    "- **Event Hub Integration:** Stream logging data to Event Hub\n",
    "- **Stream Analytics:** Process and transform log data in flight\n",
    "- **Cosmos DB Storage:** Persist structured interaction data\n",
    "- **Document Querying:** Query stored interactions for audit and analysis\n",
    "- **Data Pipeline:** Understand full flow from API to persistent storage\n",
    "- **Scalable Architecture:** Handle high-volume LLM interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. User request processed by APIM\n",
    "2. Built-in logging captures prompt, completion, and metadata\n",
    "3. Logs sent to Azure Monitor\n",
    "4. Diagnostic settings export logs to Event Hub\n",
    "5. Stream Analytics consumes Event Hub messages\n",
    "6. Analytics transforms and enriches message data\n",
    "7. Data written to Cosmos DB for long-term storage\n",
    "8. Applications query Cosmos DB for interaction history\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow Diagram\n",
    "```\n",
    "[APIM] → [Azure Monitor] → [Event Hub] → [Stream Analytics] → [Cosmos DB]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Cosmos DB account (created during deployment)\n",
    "- Event Hub namespace (created during deployment)\n",
    "- Stream Analytics job (created during deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Prompts and completions logged to Azure Monitor\n",
    "- Logs appear in Event Hub within seconds\n",
    "- Stream Analytics job processes and transforms data\n",
    "- Documents appear in Cosmos DB within 1-2 minutes\n",
    "- Can query stored interactions by user, timestamp, model\n",
    "- Audit trail shows complete interaction history\n",
    "- Token metrics aggregated and stored\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Cosmos DB Query\n",
    "```kusto\n",
    "SELECT c.user_id, c.prompt, c.completion, c.token_count, c.timestamp\n",
    "FROM messages c\n",
    "WHERE c.timestamp > GetCurrentTimestamp() - 3600\n",
    "ORDER BY c.timestamp DESC\n",

    "     \"metadata\": {}\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Compliance and auditing\n",
    "   - Conversation history\n",
    "   - User behavior analysis\n",
    "   - Quality assurance\n",
    "   - Training data collection\n",
    "   - Cost tracking per user\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compliance Benefits:**\n",
    "   - Complete audit trail\n",
    "   - Searchable conversation history\n",
    "   - Retention policy enforcement\n",
    "   - PII handling and redaction support\n",
    "   - Geographic data residency (via Cosmos DB regions)\n",

    "## 1.3 Vector Searching with RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance Azure OpenAI responses with current information from a knowledge base. This lab demonstrates how to search vector embeddings in Azure AI Search and augment LLM responses with retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Vector Embeddings:** Convert documents and queries to embeddings\n",
    "- **Azure AI Search:** Index and search documents using vector similarity\n",
    "- **RAG Pattern:** Combine retrieval with generative AI for accurate responses\n",
    "- **Prompt Augmentation:** Add retrieved context to LLM prompts\n",
    "- **End-to-End Flow:** From document ingestion through response generation\n",
    "- **APIM Gateway:** Route embedding and search requests through APIM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Knowledge base documents uploaded and indexed in Azure AI Search\n",
    "2. Each document chunked and embedded using text-embedding-3-small\n",
    "3. Vector embeddings stored in AI Search index\n",
    "4. User asks question to APIM gateway\n",
    "5. Question embedded using same embedding model\n",
    "6. AI Search performs vector similarity search\n",
    "7. Top matching documents retrieved and ranked\n",
    "8. Retrieved documents added to LLM prompt as context\n",
    "9. Azure OpenAI generates response augmented with retrieved information\n",
    "10. Response returned to user with source attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Documents] → [Chunking] → [Embedding] → [AI Search Index]\n",
    "                                              ↓\n",
    "[User Query] → [Embedding] → [Vector Search] → [Top Results]\n",
    "                                                    ↓\n",
    "[Context + Query] → [Azure OpenAI] → [Augmented Response]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor permissions\n",
    "- Azure AI Search instance (created during deployment)\n",
    "- Sample documents for knowledge base\n",
    "- text-embedding-3-small model access\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Documents successfully indexed with embeddings\n",
    "- Vector search returns relevant documents\n",
    "- Retrieved context properly formatted for LLM\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI generates contextually accurate responses\n",
    "- Source documents attributed in responses\n",
    "- Search relevance improves with better document chunking\n",
    "- Response quality enhanced by augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Metrics\n",
    "- Embedding generation latency: <1 second per query\n",
    "- Vector search latency: <500ms\n",
    "- Response generation: 2-5 seconds depending on context\n",
    "- Accuracy: Measured by user satisfaction with RAG responses"

    "   - Each document has: id, title, content, metadata\n",
    "   - Documents cover diverse domains for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generates Embeddings:**\n",
    "   - Sends each document's content to Azure OpenAI embeddings API\n",
    "   - Uses text-embedding-ada-002 model\n",
    "   - Generates 1536-dimension vectors\n",
    "   - Embeddings capture semantic meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Uploads to AI Search:**\n",
    "   - Creates/updates search index with vector field\n",
    "   - Configures vector search algorithm (HNSW)\n",
    "   - Uploads documents with embeddings\n",
    "   - Enables hybrid search (keyword + vector)\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Step 1 - Retrieve (Vector Search):**\n",
    "   - Converts query to embedding vector\n",
    "   - Searches indexed documents using vector similarity\n",
    "   - Finds top-K most relevant documents (e.g., K=3)\n",
    "   - Uses cosine similarity for ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step 2 - Augment (Context Building):**\n",
    "   - Extracts relevant content from retrieved documents\n",
    "   - Builds context string with source citations\n",
    "   - Formats context for AI model consumption\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Objective\n",
    "Understand multi-region Azure OpenAI deployment patterns by implementing backend pool load balancing. This lab demonstrates a typical prioritized PTU (Provisioned Throughput Units) with fallback consumption scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Backend Pool Configuration:** Define priority-based routing rules in APIM\n",
    "- **Load Distribution:** Understand how requests route across multiple endpoints\n",
    "- **Failover Behavior:** See graceful degradation when backends reach capacity\n",
    "- **Priority-Based Routing:** Configure primary (Priority 1) and fallback (Priority 2) endpoints\n",
    "- **Monitoring:** Track request distribution and backend health\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Client requests arrive at APIM gateway\n",
    "2. APIM evaluates backend pool configuration\n",
    "3. Priority 1 backend (highest priority PTU) receives requests first\n",
    "4. When Priority 1 is exhausted or unavailable, requests failover to Priority 2 backends\n",
    "5. Multiple Priority 2 backends are load-balanced equally\n",
    "6. Metrics show distribution of requests across backends\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Observe load distribution patterns in metrics\n",
    "- See Priority 1 backend exhaustion after threshold is reached\n",
    "- Confirm automatic failover to Priority 2 backends\n",
    "- Verify equal load distribution among Priority 2 endpoints\n",
    "- Response times remain consistent despite failover"

    "### 1.5.1 Create Backend Pool\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Creates a backend pool in APIM for distributing load across multiple Azure OpenAI regional deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- APIM service deployed\n",
    "- Three Azure OpenAI accounts in different regions (East US, West US, Sweden Central)\n",
    "- APIM Preview API version (2023-05-01-preview or later)\n",
    "- Environment variables: `APIM_SERVICE`, `RESOURCE_GROUP`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Creates a multi-region backend pool for high availability and load distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backend Pool Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Defines 3 backends (one per region)\n",
    "   - Each backend points to regional Azure OpenAI endpoint\n",
    "   - Configures weight distribution (can be equal or weighted)\n",
    "   - Sets priority for failover scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load Balancing Strategy:**\n",
    "   - **Round Robin**: Distributes requests evenly (default)\n",
    "   - **Weighted**: More traffic to higher capacity regions\n",
    "   - **Priority**: Failover to backup regions if primary fails\n",
    "   - **Performance**: Route to fastest responding region\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backend Configuration:**\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     \"backends\": [\n",
    "       {\n",
    "         \"id\": \"openai-eastus\",\n",
    "         \"url\": \"https://account-eastus.openai.azure.com\",\n",
    "         \"weight\": 33,\n",
    "         \"priority\": 1\n",
    "       },\n",
    "       {\n",
    "         \"id\": \"openai-westus\",\n",
    "         \"url\": \"https://account-westus.openai.azure.com\",\n",
    "         \"weight\": 33,\n",
    "         \"priority\": 1\n",
    "       },\n",
    "       {\n",
    "         \"id\": \"openai-swedencentral\",\n",
    "         \"url\": \"https://account-swedencentral.openai.azure.com\",\n",

    "         \"priority\": 1\n",
    "       }\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Health Checks:**\n",
    "   - APIM can probe backend health\n",
    "   - Automatically removes unhealthy backends\n",
    "   - Restores backends when health returns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Benefits:**\n",
    "   - **High Availability**: If one region fails, traffic routes to others\n",
    "   - **Performance**: Requests distributed across regions reduce queuing\n",
    "   - **Scalability**: Add more regions without client changes\n",
    "   - **Compliance**: Keep data in specific geographic regions\n",
    "   - **Cost Optimization**: Leverage regional pricing differences\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **APIM Policy Integration:**\n",
    "   - Policy uses backend pool ID instead of direct URLs\n",
    "   - APIM handles load balancing logic\n",
    "   - No client code changes required\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "Backend pool creation results:\n",
    "✅ Backend pool created successfully\n",
    "- Pool ID: openai-backend-pool\n",
    "- Backends: 3 regions\n",

    "  * West US: 33% weight, priority 1\n",
    "  * Sweden Central: 34% weight, priority 1\n",

    "6. APIM applies all configured policies:\n",
    "   - Load balancing\n",
    "   - Rate limiting\n",
    "   - Content safety\n",
    "   - Token metrics\n",
    "   - Semantic caching\n",
    "   - Logging\n",
    "7. Requests forwarded to backend Azure OpenAI\n",
    "8. Responses returned through APIM to application\n",
    "\n",

    "- Azure CLI installed\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor permissions\n",
    "- AI Foundry project created\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI connection configured with APIM endpoint\n",
    "- APIM subscription key configured\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- AI Foundry SDK initializes successfully\n",
    "- Requests are routed through APIM (visible in APIM logs)\n",
    "- Chat completions work through SDK\n",
    "- All APIM policies apply to SDK requests\n",
    "- Can track SDK usage in APIM analytics\n",
    "- No code changes needed to use APIM gateway\n",
    "- Token metrics appear in Application Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection Configuration Format\n",
    "```\n",
    "Provider: Azure OpenAI\n",
    "Endpoint: https://{APIM_GATEWAY}.azure-api.net\n",
    "Key: {APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}\n",
    "API Version: 2024-08-01-preview\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Benefits\n",
    "1. **Centralized Governance:** All AI Foundry SDK requests through APIM policies\n",
    "2. **Unified Monitoring:** Track all interactions in one place\n",
    "3. **Multi-Region Support:** APIM load balancing benefits\n",
    "4. **Cost Control:** Token metrics and rate limiting\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Steps for MCP Server Publishing\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare Your Environment:**\n",
      "   - Install necessary software, SDKs, and tools that you will use for development and deployment.\n",
      "   - Ensure your server meets all the technical requirements for MCP.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Create and Configure the MCP Server:**\n",
      "   - Use the Azure portal or command-line tools to create your server instance.\n",
      "   - Configure networking settings (such as virtual networks and public IP addresses).\n",
      "   - Set up authentication and authorization mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Develop Your Application:**\n",
      "   - Build the application you wish to host on the MCP server.\n",
      "   - Utilize cloud services (such as databases, storage, etc.) as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Deployment:**\n",
      "   - Choose a deployment method (e.g., using Azure Resource Manager templates, manual deployment, etc.).\n",
      "   - Upload your application to the server using the appropriate tools (Azure CLI, Azure DevOps, FTP, etc.).\n",
      "   - If necessary, configure web server settings (IIS for Windows, Nginx/Apache for Linux).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Configure Monitoring and Scaling:**\n",
      "   - Set up application insights and monitoring tools to keep track of performance.\n",
      "   - Configure autoscaling rules based on server load.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Security Configurations:**\n",
      "   - Implement firewalls and security groups to control access.\n",
      "   - Regularly update and patch your server to safeguard against threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Testing:**\n",
      "   - Conduct thorough testing (functional, load, security) to ensure stability and performance.\n",
      "   - Check for proper configuration of endpoints and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Go Live:**\n",
      "   - Make the application live and accessible to users.\n",
      "   - Monitor traffic and performance closely after launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Maintenance:**\n",
      "   - Implement a maintenance plan for updates, backups, and performance tuning.\n",
      "   - Regularly review application performance and make adjustments as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Documentation and Support\n",
      "- Always refer to [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/) for detailed steps and best practices.\n",
      "- Utilize community forums and support platforms if you encounter issues.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Demonstrates accessing OpenWeather API through APIM as an MCP-style data source\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- APIM deployed with Weather API configured\n",
    "- OpenWeather API key configured\n",
    "- Environment variables: `APIM_WEATHER_URL`, `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does**:\n",
    "**Accesses weather data through APIM gateway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weather API Features:**\n",
    "   - Current weather for any city\n",
    "   - Multi-day forecasts\n",
    "   - Weather alerts\n",
    "   - Historical weather data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **APIM Benefits:**\n",
    "   - Hides actual API key from clients\n",
    "   - Applies rate limiting\n",
    "   - Caches weather responses\n",
    "   - Transforms response format\n",
    "   - Logs all weather queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Queries:**\n",
    "   - Current weather in Seattle\n",
    "   - 5-day forecast for Paris\n",
    "   - Weather alerts for region\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integration with AI:**\n",
    "   - AI can call weather API via function calling\n",
    "   - Natural language: \"What's the weather in Tokyo?\"\n",
    "   - AI extracts city name and calls API\n",
    "   - Returns formatted weather info\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates using APIM as a unified gateway for both AI models and traditional APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**:\n",
    "Weather API test results:\n",
    "📍 **Seattle, WA**\n",
    "🌡️ Temperature: 45°F (7°C)\n",
    "☁️ Conditions: Partly Cloudy\n",
    "💨 Wind: 8 mph NW\n",
    "💧 Humidity: 72%\n",

    "#### Objective\n",
    "Integrate GitHub repository access through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to enable Azure OpenAI to read and analyze repository content. This lab demonstrates how to query GitHub repositories, list files, and retrieve content programmatically through APIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **MCP Server Integration:** Connect to GitHub API via MCP protocol\n",
    "- **Repository Navigation:** Browse files and directory structures\n",
    "- **Content Retrieval:** Fetch file contents for analysis\n",
    "- **HTTP-Based MCP:** Use REST API to communicate with MCP servers\n",
    "- **APIM Routing:** Route MCP requests through APIM gateway\n",
    "- **Authentication:** Manage GitHub API credentials securely\n",
    "- **Data Processing:** Feed repository data to Azure OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Azure OpenAI needs to access GitHub repository data\n",
    "2. Function call requests GitHub repository MCP server via APIM\n",
    "3. MCP server receives request through `/mcp/` HTTP endpoint\n",
    "4. Server authenticates with GitHub API using configured credentials\n",
    "5. Server executes tool (list files, read content, etc.)\n",
    "6. Response returned to APIM\n",
    "7. APIM proxies response back to Azure OpenAI\n",
    "8. Azure OpenAI processes repository data and generates analysis\n",
    "9. Final response returned to user\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Flow\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Azure OpenAI] → [APIM Gateway] → [GitHub MCP Server] → [GitHub API]\n",
    "     ↓                                    ↓\n",
    "  Response ← [Tool Result] ← [File Content] ← [GitHub]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor permissions\n",
    "- GitHub Account with repository access\n",
    "- GitHub personal access token (for API authentication)\n",
    "- MCP servers initialized (Cell 11)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Successfully list files in GitHub repository\n",
    "- Retrieve file contents from repository\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI can access repository structure\n",
    "- Function calls to GitHub MCP work through APIM\n",
    "- Responses properly formatted for LLM consumption\n",
    "- Can analyze repository structure and content\n",
    "- Performance metrics show latency through APIM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MCP Server Configuration\n",
    "```\n",
    "Protocol: HTTP POST\n",
    "Endpoint: https://{mcp-server}/mcp/\n",
    "Authentication: GitHub Personal Access Token\n",
    "Supported Tools:\n",
    "  - list_repository_files\n",
    "  - read_file_content\n",
    "  - get_repository_info\n",
    "  - search_files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Use Cases\n",
    "1. **Code Review:** Analyze code structure and patterns\n",
    "2. **Documentation Generation:** Create docs from code\n",
    "3. **Dependency Analysis:** Understand project dependencies\n",
    "4. **Architecture Understanding:** Map codebase structure"

    "## 3.5 Built-in LLM Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Enable comprehensive observability of all LLM interactions through APIM's built-in logging capabilities. Automatically capture prompts, completions, and token consumption to Azure Monitor for compliance, debugging, and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- **Built-in Logging:** Configure APIM to automatically log LLM interactions\n",
    "- **Azure Monitor Integration:** Send logs to Azure Monitor for centralized analysis\n",
    "- **KQL Queries:** Write queries to analyze prompt and completion patterns\n",
    "- **Token Tracking:** Monitor token consumption across all requests\n",
    "- **Diagnostic Settings:** Route logs to Log Analytics, Event Hub, and Storage\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting:** Debug issues using detailed interaction logs\n",
    "- **Compliance:** Maintain audit trails for regulatory requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "1. Request arrives at APIM with user prompt\n",
    "2. Built-in logging policy captures full request/response\n",
    "3. Extracts: prompt text, completion text, token counts\n",
    "4. Logs sent to Azure Monitor Diagnostic Logs\n",
    "5. Logs routed to:\n",
    "   - Log Analytics workspace for querying\n",
    "   - Event Hub for real-time streaming\n",
    "   - Storage account for long-term archival\n",
    "6. Can create alerts based on log patterns\n",
    "7. Dashboards visualize logging metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or later\n",
    "- VS Code with Jupyter notebook extension\n",
    "- Python environment with requirements.txt dependencies\n",
    "- Azure Subscription with Contributor + RBAC Administrator roles\n",
    "- Azure CLI installed and authenticated\n",
    "- Log Analytics workspace (created during deployment)\n",
    "- APIM diagnostic settings configured\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- All API requests logged to Azure Monitor\n",
    "- Prompts and completions captured in full detail\n",
    "- Token counts tracked for cost analysis\n",
    "- Can query logs using KQL within 2-5 minutes\n",
    "- Logs appear in configured destinations (Log Analytics, Event Hub, etc.)\n",
    "- Can search logs by user, timestamp, model, or response status\n",
    "- Dashboards show real-time logging metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample KQL Query\n",
    "```kusto\n",
    "AzureDiagnostics\n",
    "| where ResourceProvider == \"MICROSOFT.APIMANAGEMENT\"\n",
    "| where OperationName contains \"ChatCompletion\"\n",

    "#### Key Monitored Data\n",
    "- Prompt text (first 500 characters)\n",
    "- Completion text (first 1000 characters)\n",
    "- Total tokens, prompt tokens, completion tokens\n",
    "- Request/response status codes\n",
    "- Backend latency\n",
    "- Client IP address\n",
    "- Request timestamp"

    "1. **Creates Varied Requests:**\n",
    "   - Different models: gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4\n",
    "   - Different prompt lengths\n",
    "   - Different response lengths\n",
    "   - Different users/subscriptions\n",

    "2. **Test Scenarios:**\n",
    "   - Short prompts (10-50 tokens)\n",
    "   - Medium prompts (50-200 tokens)\n",
    "   - Long prompts (200-500 tokens)\n",
    "   - Streaming vs non-streaming\n",

    "   - Model used\n",
    "   - Tokens consumed (prompt + completion)\n",
    "   - Response time\n",

    "4. **Logging Integration:**\n",
    "   - APIM policy intercepts each request\n",
    "   - Extracts token usage from response\n",

    "**Retrieves and displays actual conversation content from logs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **KQL Query for Content:**\n",
    "   ```kql\n",
    "   ApiManagementGatewayLogs\n",
    "   | where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)\n",
    "   | where OperationId == \"chatcompletions\"\n",

    "   - Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)\n",
    "   - Implement access controls (who can view logs)\n",
    "   - Consider PII redaction policies\n",
    "   - Set appropriate retention periods\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Content Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Identify inappropriate content\n",
    "   - Detect policy violations\n",
    "   - Find training opportunities\n",
