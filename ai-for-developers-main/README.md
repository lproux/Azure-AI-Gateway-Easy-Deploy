# Eng Hub guidance on AI tools for Microsoft developers

Working with Subject Matter Experts across Microsoft, including 1ES, DSR, CELA, this content is a place to
attempt to document guidance around third-party AI models and developer use at Microsoft.

## Content update proposals

The original effort in H2 FY25 to produce an initial set of guidance around AI tools at large (i.e. the
Cline conversation) has concluded.

An ongoing MCP effort is active, with information contacted in the `mcp/` folder of this repo. There is
information on "sponsoring" an MCP server internally, for example, including championing security and other
reviews.

As we enter FY26, there is not yet a concrete process in place for reviewing new suggestions to update the
list.

If you would like to propose updates to the content, please submit a very complete pull request containing
information about content that has been reviewed by SMEs, or, if tactical and straightforward (typos), say
so.

General models guidance coordinator: No current process to renew or review, no DRI on the 1ES side.
MCP coordinator in 1ES: `manjur`
